It is rare in the UK, but can be fatal. The symptoms are caused by toxins produced by the bacteria once it enters the body.   The bacteria that cause tetanus can live in the gut and faeces of horses and other animals.  The bacteria itself is anaerobic (lives in an oxygen-free environment), but it produces spores which allow it to reproduce. These spores can live in lots of different environments including ones with oxygen, like on surfaces and in soil, and can survive for a very long time.

The Facebook post claims: “If your wound was not caused by a rusty nail (embedded in a place where cattle, sheep, or horses graze and poop, or where cattle, sheep, or horses used to graze or poop) or a pitch fork while mucking stalls... you most likely don’t have to worry about tetanus.” This isn’t true. While some types of injuries may pose a higher risk than others, the NHS website describes several different types of injury that could pose a risk of tetanus infection, especially if you are not vaccinated, including eye injury, contaminated injections, piercings, burns and animal bites.

2,,,,False,Leo Benedictus,2021-07-27,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/health/robert-peston-reinfections/,The daily number of Covid-19 cases seriously understates the real total because it does not count reinfections.,2021-07-27,fullfact,,"ITV News’s political editor Robert Peston said in a tweet that the number of Covid-19 cases being reported each day on the government’s Coronavirus Dashboard “seriously understates” the real number, because people who catch the disease more than once are not counted after the first time. While it is true that these reinfections are not counted as new cases on the dashboard, this is unlikely to mean that the daily case number “seriously understates” the number of cases each day. According to figures published by Public Health England (PHE), there have been 23,105 “possible reinfections” of Covid-19 in England up to 4 July 2021. PHE defines a possible reinfection as one person giving two positive tests “at least 90 days apart”. These are not definite reinfections, however. PHE says: “For a possible reinfection to be categorised as confirmed it requires sequencing of a specimen at each episode and for the later specimen to be genetically distinct from that sequenced from the earlier episode.” This is often not possible, however, since not all positive samples are genomically sequenced. The proportion of cases that are suspected reinfections changes from week to week, but the overall rate has been estimated by a PHE epidemiologist at around 1%. On the day that Mr Peston posted his tweet, 29,173 new cases were reported in the UK on the Coronavirus Dashboard. If a further 1% had been detected as reinfections and added to the total, following the pattern in England, this would have amounted to an extra 290 cases or so. It is possible that reinfections may become more common over time, if immunity from past infections wanes, or if new variants of Covid prove more likely to reinfect people. (Indeed there are indications that PHE may monitor reinfections more closely in future.) Reinfections aside, it’s true that the number of cases reported each day does underestimate the total number of actual infections in the real world, since some infections are asymptomatic and not everyone gets tested. Overall though, it is not right to say that the reported daily case total “seriously understates” the total number of detected cases, as the current evidence suggests it would be only 1% higher if reinfections were included. Mr Peston has since clarified that his concern was that “the quality of the dashboard infections data was not what it should be because of the policy driven exclusion of those who have been infected a second time”.","https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/about-data#:~:text=If%20a%20person%20has%20more%20than%20one%20positive%20test%2C%20they%20are%20only%20counted%20as%20one%20case.,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1005056/Weekly_Flu_and_COVID-19_report_w29.pdf#page=18,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1005056/Weekly_Flu_and_COVID-19_report_w29.pdf#page=17,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-exceeds-600000-covid-19-tests-genomically-sequenced,https://twitter.com/kallmemeg/status/1419246354224848897?s=20,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases#card-cases_by_date_reported,https://twitter.com/kallmemeg/status/1419249293693698049,https://twitter.com/Peston/status/1419683464408875012?s=20,https://fullfact.org/health/tetanus-risk-social-media/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/vaccinated-Covid-19-deaths/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/self-isolation-support/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/richard-tice-covid-vaccine-infertility-stillbirth/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/charles-walker-youngsters-covid-risk/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Robert Peston overstated the importance of reinfections,,,,,,

Baroness Wheeler, a Labour peer, tabled another amendment highlighting the fact that “a full impact assessment has not been published including analysis of the number of current staff who may not comply and the potential impact on care homes if care home staff become ineligible for work because they are not fully vaccinated or medically exempt”.  The lack of an impact statement also prompted the Regulatory Policy Committee (RPC), an independent group who assess the quality of evidence and analysis used to inform regulatory proposals across a number of policy areas, to say the Department of Health and Social Care should have produced an assessment and presented it to the RPC for scrutiny. The RPC also said it should have been seen by ministers and presented to Parliament before it was debated in the House of Commons.  Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi had said at a meeting of the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee on 13 July, that the impact assessment was being worked on and would hopefully be made available by the end of that month.  During the debate on this in the Lords, Baroness Wheeler said that an impact statement had been provided, but not a more thorough impact assessment.","https://www.facebook.com/cassiesunshine369/posts/10157902819056857,https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/health-and-social-care-act-2008-regulated-activities-amendment-coronavirus-regulations-2021/#:~:text=would%20make%20it%20a%20requirement%20for%20workers%20in%20care%20homes%20to%20be%20fully%20vaccinated%20against%20coronavirus,https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/891/contents/made,https://commonsbusiness.parliament.uk/document/49419/html#:~:text=11National%20Health%20Service,accordingly%20agreed%20to.,https://commonsbusiness.parliament.uk/document/49419/html#:~:text=11National%20Health%20Service,accordingly%20agreed%20to.,https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/891/contents/made,https://votes.parliament.uk/Votes/Lords/Division/2552,https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/regulatory-policy-committee/about#:~:text=we%20assess%20the%20quality%20of%20evidence%20and%20analysis%20used%20to%20inform%20regulatory%20proposals%20affecting%20the%20economy%2C%20businesses%2C%20civil%20society%2C%20charities%20and%20other%20non-government%20organisations.,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/regulatory-policy-committee-statement-on-the-draft-health-and-social-care-act-2008-regulated-activities-amendment-coronavirus-regulations-2021,https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/2542/html/#:~:text=You%20are%20absolutely,with%20your%20permission.,https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2021-07-20/debates/8154B2EF-D373-4C43-8831-A6B79BCC29CA/Debate#contribution-DE2918F9-74F8-4FF5-A520-7290D1B589F6,https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/making-vaccination-a-condition-of-deployment-in-older-adult-care-homes/outcome/statement-of-impact-the-health-and-social-care-act-2008-regulated-activities-amendment-coronavirus-regulations-2021#cost-implications-for-care-home-providers,https://fullfact.org/online/boris-johnson-three-covid-vaccine-pictures/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Mandatory Covid-19 vaccine is only for care home workers,,,,,,

Although the virus can be passed on from both vaccinated and unvaccinated people, we know that people who are vaccinated are less likely to transmit the virus. A July 2021 publication from PHE showed that amongst cases of the delta variant (which is now dominant in the UK), there have been 257 deaths within 28 days of a positive test in England since February 2021. Of these, just under half had received two doses of vaccine,  17% were amongst those who’d had the first dose and tested positive after a 21 day period (the time taken to build immunity), and 36% of those deaths were amongst unvaccinated people.

6,,,,False,Leo Benedictus,2021-07-23,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/news/dawn-butler-boris-johnson-lying/,Vaccines have severed the link between Covid-19 infections and serious disease or death.,2021-07-23,fullfact,,"In a speech to Parliament on 22 July, the Labour MP Dawn Butler said that Boris Johnson “has lied to this House and the country, over and over again”. This broke the rules about “unparliamentary language”, which say that accusations of “deliberate falsehood” must only be made with prior permission of the Speaker. Ms Butler did not withdraw her comments and was asked to leave the House for the rest of the day as a result. Ms Butler based most of her claims that the Prime Minister lied on a widely viewed video from the lawyer and campaigner Peter Stefanovic. It is often impossible to say for sure whether somebody is “lying”, because you’d need to know that they intended to deceive people. At Full Fact, our focus is on whether the claim being made is true, not the intention behind it. However, it is correct that the majority of Mr Johnson’s claims that Ms Butler mentioned were either false or misleading.   On 29 January 2020, Boris Johnson said: “The economy, under this Conservative government, has grown by 73%.” Ms Butler is correct that this claim is false. As we wrote at the time, and as Mr Stefanovic says in his video, the 73% figure describes growth since 1990, not since 2010, which means it covers a much longer period that also includes 13 years of Labour government.   On 26 February 2020, Boris Johnson did say: “We have restored the nurses’ bursary.” He made similar claims on 4 March 2020 and 19 May 2021. A bursary for student nurses was reintroduced in 2019, but it did not restore funding for tuition fees that existed before. Under the bursary scheme which existed until 2017, new nursing students were entitled to a non-means tested grant of £1,000 a year, and a means tested bursary to help with living costs up to £3,191. Additional funding elements were available for certain students. Students who qualified for a bursary also had the costs of their tuition paid.  In 2017, following plans announced by George Osborne in 2015, the Conservative government led by Theresa May replaced this bursary with access to the full loan system used by other students, and began requiring student nurses to pay their own tuition fees. Some extra grants remained available for students with children or experiencing hardship. In December 2019, the Conservative government led by Boris Johnson announced the introduction of an additional £5,000 grant for all student nurses to help with living costs, with an additional £3,000 available for some eligible students. However, students would continue to pay their own tuition fees. This is not the same system that existed before 2017, so in that sense it is not true that the old bursary has been “restored”. Mr Johnson’s government has reintroduced a system in which all student nurses receive a non-repayable grant from the government, but it does not pay their tuition fees on their behalf, which was the system when the old bursary applied.   The Prime Minister said on 24 June 2020: “The [Covid-19 contact-tracing] app would be the icing on the cake, if we can get it to work. If we can get it to work, it would be a fine thing, but there isn’t one anywhere in the world so far.” We checked a similar claim that he made the day before, when he said: “No country currently has a functioning track and trace app”. The truth of this really depends on what you think it means for a contact-tracing app to “work” or “function”. Many countries had launched apps that were operational when the Prime Minister was speaking. However, at the time it was not yet clear whether any of their technological approaches were effective, or whether they’d been downloaded widely enough to reduce the spread of Covid. There is now some evidence that contact-tracing apps have been effective to some extent in several countries, including the UK. Arguably, Mr Johnson oversimplified the situation by claiming that no app was working anywhere (when he couldn’t yet be sure, and apps were certainly available and being downloaded by millions of people), but Ms Butler also oversimplified things by claiming that he was definitely wrong (which we can’t be sure he was at the time, either).     Mr Johnson said on 15 July 2020 that “the government are engaged in record investments in the NHS of £34bn.” And it was not the first time he had made this claim. Technically speaking, it is true in absolute cash terms, but this is a misleading way to measure it.   As we explained in November 2019, the government did announce a £34 billion spending increase for the NHS between 2018/19 and 2023/24. However, this figure does not account for inflation, which tends to make the actual value of a sum of money diminish over time. If you do account for inflation, which is the fairest way to compare sums of money across time, then the ‘real terms’ value of the spending increase was £20.5 billion. Nor is this spending increase a “record”. The last time NHS spending rose by at least this much in real terms was between 2004/05 and 2009/10.   This comes from Prime Minister’s Questions on 7 July 2021, when Mr Johnson said: “Scientists are also absolutely clear that we have severed the link between infection and serious disease and death.” Ms Butler is correct that this is not true. Vaccination is highly effective against the worst effects of Covid-19, but it is not perfectly effective. Recent data from Public Health England shows that even fully vaccinated people do sometimes get seriously ill with the disease, and a few still die. It is therefore not right to say that the link has been completely “severed” between infection and serious disease or death, although it has certainly been severely weakened. We have not attempted to determine whether the Prime Minister was ‘lying’ in any of these instances. The Ministerial Code states: “It is of paramount importance that Ministers give accurate and truthful information to Parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity.” The Prime Minister has corrected none of the errors mentioned in this piece, at the time of writing.","https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/e9085c07-ac3b-43dd-9dbf-71911d435363?in=15:37:55&out=15:39:46,https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmproced/writev/language/p19.htm,https://twitter.com/PeterStefanovi2/status/1417524808141639682?s=20,https://twitter.com/PeterStefanovi2/status/1417524808141639682?s=20,https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-01-29/debates/821DAC2A-A644-40CF-86AE-5D8CB585640D/Engagements#contribution-6FD04C53-12E7-47D0-B2DF-25B5857BD6C7,https://fullfact.org/economy/boris-johnson-economic-growth/,https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-02-26/debates/6A733918-AC43-4143-A629-0BA4AF5A932B/Engagements#contribution-5D74B73E-78A7-437F-84C3-5D6DD99E8A8C,https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-03-04/debates/034D0B7F-9941-489F-ADDD-69F0E6FC7CA9/Engagements#contribution-DC09ECB4-8137-41A1-B314-DA2E27FC34D5,https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-05-19/debates/C4EF032A-1F6B-429D-934D-B8BBF28D7B95/Engagements#contribution-357DC6C3-1BD3-49BF-B747-783999136D83,https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7436/CBP-7436.pdf#page=7,https://web.archive.org/web/20170329095234/http:/www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk:80/Documents/Students/Your_guide_to_NHS_Student_Bursaries_2016_-17_(V1)_09.2015_Web.pdf#page=4,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/spending-review-and-autumn-statement-2015-key-announcements,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-bursary-reform/nhs-bursary-reform#why-changes-to-funding-have-been-made,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-bursary-reform/nhs-bursary-reform#additional-funding,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nursing-students-to-receive-5-000-payment-a-year,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nursing-students-to-receive-5-000-payment-a-year,https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-06-24/debates/A22E1955-6855-4DCA-B5A8-0A0D97A71BB5/PrimeMinister#contribution-68A65581-DFA5-452D-A4EE-91036487A53F,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-track-and-trace-app-boris-johnson/,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00451-y,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-track-and-trace-app-boris-johnson/,https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-07-15/debates/8EB241F4-52D1-4AAD-9A64-D1D544FEE903/Engagements#contribution-A9E9FA33-D061-43FC-AE47-3AE1E59E7BB7,https://fullfact.org/health/boris-johnsons-first-interview-2020-fact-checked/,https://fullfact.org/election-2019/nhs-spending-biggest-boost/,https://fullfact.org/economy/economics-glossary/#:~:text=If%20an%20amount%20of%20money,%E2%80%9Creal%20terms%E2%80%9D%20pay%20rise.,https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-07-07/debates/1C736EA1-AB82-4BE4-81D6-9D2F284BEAB3/Engagements#contribution-630FC374-5980-43EC-A603-37F1237EDAEC,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-hospitalisation-from-delta-variant,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1005517/Technical_Briefing_19.pdf#page=18,https://fullfact.org/online/fully-vaccinated-deaths-daily-expose/,https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmproced/622/622ap28.htm,https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?memberId=1423&startDate=07%2F23%2F2016%2000%3A00%3A00&endDate=07%2F23%2F2021%2000%3A00%3A00&type=Corrections,https://fullfact.org/news/boris-johnson-whatsapp-covid-life-expectancy-cummings/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/what-has-prime-minister-said-about-booing-england-players/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/times-woke-survey/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/michael-gove-public-first/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/sun-cancel-culture/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Was Dawn Butler right about Boris Johnson ‘lying’ to Parliament?,,,,,,

This broke the rules about “unparliamentary language”, which say that accusations of “deliberate falsehood” must only be made with prior permission of the Speaker. Ms Butler did not withdraw her comments and was asked to leave the House for the rest of the day as a result. Ms Butler based most of her claims that the Prime Minister lied on a widely viewed video from the lawyer and campaigner Peter Stefanovic. It is often impossible to say for sure whether somebody is “lying”, because you’d need to know that they intended to deceive people. At Full Fact, our focus is on whether the claim being made is true, not the intention behind it. However, it is correct that the majority of Mr Johnson’s claims that Ms Butler mentioned were either false or misleading.   On 29 January 2020, Boris Johnson said: “The economy, under this Conservative government, has grown by 73%.” Ms Butler is correct that this claim is false. As we wrote at the time, and as Mr Stefanovic says in his video, the 73% figure describes growth since 1990, not since 2010, which means it covers a much longer period that also includes 13 years of Labour government.   On 26 February 2020, Boris Johnson did say: “We have restored the nurses’ bursary.” He made similar claims on 4 March 2020 and 19 May 2021.

9,,,,False,Leo Benedictus,2021-07-23,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/news/dawn-butler-boris-johnson-lying/,Vaccines have severed the link between Covid-19 infections and serious disease or death.,2021-07-23,fullfact,,"In a speech to Parliament on 22 July, the Labour MP Dawn Butler said that Boris Johnson “has lied to this House and the country, over and over again”. This broke the rules about “unparliamentary language”, which say that accusations of “deliberate falsehood” must only be made with prior permission of the Speaker. Ms Butler did not withdraw her comments and was asked to leave the House for the rest of the day as a result. Ms Butler based most of her claims that the Prime Minister lied on a widely viewed video from the lawyer and campaigner Peter Stefanovic. It is often impossible to say for sure whether somebody is “lying”, because you’d need to know that they intended to deceive people. At Full Fact, our focus is on whether the claim being made is true, not the intention behind it. However, it is correct that the majority of Mr Johnson’s claims that Ms Butler mentioned were either false or misleading.   On 29 January 2020, Boris Johnson said: “The economy, under this Conservative government, has grown by 73%.” Ms Butler is correct that this claim is false. As we wrote at the time, and as Mr Stefanovic says in his video, the 73% figure describes growth since 1990, not since 2010, which means it covers a much longer period that also includes 13 years of Labour government.   On 26 February 2020, Boris Johnson did say: “We have restored the nurses’ bursary.” He made similar claims on 4 March 2020 and 19 May 2021. A bursary for student nurses was reintroduced in 2019, but it did not restore funding for tuition fees that existed before. Under the bursary scheme which existed until 2017, new nursing students were entitled to a non-means tested grant of £1,000 a year, and a means tested bursary to help with living costs up to £3,191. Additional funding elements were available for certain students. Students who qualified for a bursary also had the costs of their tuition paid.  In 2017, following plans announced by George Osborne in 2015, the Conservative government led by Theresa May replaced this bursary with access to the full loan system used by other students, and began requiring student nurses to pay their own tuition fees. Some extra grants remained available for students with children or experiencing hardship. In December 2019, the Conservative government led by Boris Johnson announced the introduction of an additional £5,000 grant for all student nurses to help with living costs, with an additional £3,000 available for some eligible students. However, students would continue to pay their own tuition fees. This is not the same system that existed before 2017, so in that sense it is not true that the old bursary has been “restored”. Mr Johnson’s government has reintroduced a system in which all student nurses receive a non-repayable grant from the government, but it does not pay their tuition fees on their behalf, which was the system when the old bursary applied.   The Prime Minister said on 24 June 2020: “The [Covid-19 contact-tracing] app would be the icing on the cake, if we can get it to work. If we can get it to work, it would be a fine thing, but there isn’t one anywhere in the world so far.” We checked a similar claim that he made the day before, when he said: “No country currently has a functioning track and trace app”. The truth of this really depends on what you think it means for a contact-tracing app to “work” or “function”. Many countries had launched apps that were operational when the Prime Minister was speaking. However, at the time it was not yet clear whether any of their technological approaches were effective, or whether they’d been downloaded widely enough to reduce the spread of Covid. There is now some evidence that contact-tracing apps have been effective to some extent in several countries, including the UK. Arguably, Mr Johnson oversimplified the situation by claiming that no app was working anywhere (when he couldn’t yet be sure, and apps were certainly available and being downloaded by millions of people), but Ms Butler also oversimplified things by claiming that he was definitely wrong (which we can’t be sure he was at the time, either).     Mr Johnson said on 15 July 2020 that “the government are engaged in record investments in the NHS of £34bn.” And it was not the first time he had made this claim. Technically speaking, it is true in absolute cash terms, but this is a misleading way to measure it.   As we explained in November 2019, the government did announce a £34 billion spending increase for the NHS between 2018/19 and 2023/24. However, this figure does not account for inflation, which tends to make the actual value of a sum of money diminish over time. If you do account for inflation, which is the fairest way to compare sums of money across time, then the ‘real terms’ value of the spending increase was £20.5 billion. Nor is this spending increase a “record”. The last time NHS spending rose by at least this much in real terms was between 2004/05 and 2009/10.   This comes from Prime Minister’s Questions on 7 July 2021, when Mr Johnson said: “Scientists are also absolutely clear that we have severed the link between infection and serious disease and death.” Ms Butler is correct that this is not true. Vaccination is highly effective against the worst effects of Covid-19, but it is not perfectly effective. Recent data from Public Health England shows that even fully vaccinated people do sometimes get seriously ill with the disease, and a few still die. It is therefore not right to say that the link has been completely “severed” between infection and serious disease or death, although it has certainly been severely weakened. We have not attempted to determine whether the Prime Minister was ‘lying’ in any of these instances. The Ministerial Code states: “It is of paramount importance that Ministers give accurate and truthful information to Parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity.” The Prime Minister has corrected none of the errors mentioned in this piece, at the time of writing.","https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/e9085c07-ac3b-43dd-9dbf-71911d435363?in=15:37:55&out=15:39:46,https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmproced/writev/language/p19.htm,https://twitter.com/PeterStefanovi2/status/1417524808141639682?s=20,https://twitter.com/PeterStefanovi2/status/1417524808141639682?s=20,https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-01-29/debates/821DAC2A-A644-40CF-86AE-5D8CB585640D/Engagements#contribution-6FD04C53-12E7-47D0-B2DF-25B5857BD6C7,https://fullfact.org/economy/boris-johnson-economic-growth/,https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-02-26/debates/6A733918-AC43-4143-A629-0BA4AF5A932B/Engagements#contribution-5D74B73E-78A7-437F-84C3-5D6DD99E8A8C,https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-03-04/debates/034D0B7F-9941-489F-ADDD-69F0E6FC7CA9/Engagements#contribution-DC09ECB4-8137-41A1-B314-DA2E27FC34D5,https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-05-19/debates/C4EF032A-1F6B-429D-934D-B8BBF28D7B95/Engagements#contribution-357DC6C3-1BD3-49BF-B747-783999136D83,https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7436/CBP-7436.pdf#page=7,https://web.archive.org/web/20170329095234/http:/www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk:80/Documents/Students/Your_guide_to_NHS_Student_Bursaries_2016_-17_(V1)_09.2015_Web.pdf#page=4,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/spending-review-and-autumn-statement-2015-key-announcements,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-bursary-reform/nhs-bursary-reform#why-changes-to-funding-have-been-made,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-bursary-reform/nhs-bursary-reform#additional-funding,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nursing-students-to-receive-5-000-payment-a-year,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nursing-students-to-receive-5-000-payment-a-year,https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-06-24/debates/A22E1955-6855-4DCA-B5A8-0A0D97A71BB5/PrimeMinister#contribution-68A65581-DFA5-452D-A4EE-91036487A53F,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-track-and-trace-app-boris-johnson/,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00451-y,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-track-and-trace-app-boris-johnson/,https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-07-15/debates/8EB241F4-52D1-4AAD-9A64-D1D544FEE903/Engagements#contribution-A9E9FA33-D061-43FC-AE47-3AE1E59E7BB7,https://fullfact.org/health/boris-johnsons-first-interview-2020-fact-checked/,https://fullfact.org/election-2019/nhs-spending-biggest-boost/,https://fullfact.org/economy/economics-glossary/#:~:text=If%20an%20amount%20of%20money,%E2%80%9Creal%20terms%E2%80%9D%20pay%20rise.,https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-07-07/debates/1C736EA1-AB82-4BE4-81D6-9D2F284BEAB3/Engagements#contribution-630FC374-5980-43EC-A603-37F1237EDAEC,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-hospitalisation-from-delta-variant,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1005517/Technical_Briefing_19.pdf#page=18,https://fullfact.org/online/fully-vaccinated-deaths-daily-expose/,https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmproced/622/622ap28.htm,https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?memberId=1423&startDate=07%2F23%2F2016%2000%3A00%3A00&endDate=07%2F23%2F2021%2000%3A00%3A00&type=Corrections,https://fullfact.org/news/boris-johnson-whatsapp-covid-life-expectancy-cummings/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/what-has-prime-minister-said-about-booing-england-players/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/times-woke-survey/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/michael-gove-public-first/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/sun-cancel-culture/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Was Dawn Butler right about Boris Johnson ‘lying’ to Parliament?,,,,,,

The Ministerial Code states: “It is of paramount importance that Ministers give accurate and truthful information to Parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity.” The Prime Minister has corrected none of the errors mentioned in this piece, at the time of writing.","https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/e9085c07-ac3b-43dd-9dbf-71911d435363?in=15:37:55&out=15:39:46,https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmproced/writev/language/p19.htm,https://twitter.com/PeterStefanovi2/status/1417524808141639682?s=20,https://twitter.com/PeterStefanovi2/status/1417524808141639682?s=20,https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-01-29/debates/821DAC2A-A644-40CF-86AE-5D8CB585640D/Engagements#contribution-6FD04C53-12E7-47D0-B2DF-25B5857BD6C7,https://fullfact.org/economy/boris-johnson-economic-growth/,https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-02-26/debates/6A733918-AC43-4143-A629-0BA4AF5A932B/Engagements#contribution-5D74B73E-78A7-437F-84C3-5D6DD99E8A8C,https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-03-04/debates/034D0B7F-9941-489F-ADDD-69F0E6FC7CA9/Engagements#contribution-DC09ECB4-8137-41A1-B314-DA2E27FC34D5,https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-05-19/debates/C4EF032A-1F6B-429D-934D-B8BBF28D7B95/Engagements#contribution-357DC6C3-1BD3-49BF-B747-783999136D83,https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7436/CBP-7436.pdf#page=7,https://web.archive.org/web/20170329095234/http:/www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk:80/Documents/Students/Your_guide_to_NHS_Student_Bursaries_2016_-17_(V1)_09.2015_Web.pdf#page=4,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/spending-review-and-autumn-statement-2015-key-announcements,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-bursary-reform/nhs-bursary-reform#why-changes-to-funding-have-been-made,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-bursary-reform/nhs-bursary-reform#additional-funding,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nursing-students-to-receive-5-000-payment-a-year,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nursing-students-to-receive-5-000-payment-a-year,https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-06-24/debates/A22E1955-6855-4DCA-B5A8-0A0D97A71BB5/PrimeMinister#contribution-68A65581-DFA5-452D-A4EE-91036487A53F,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-track-and-trace-app-boris-johnson/,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00451-y,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-track-and-trace-app-boris-johnson/,https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-07-15/debates/8EB241F4-52D1-4AAD-9A64-D1D544FEE903/Engagements#contribution-A9E9FA33-D061-43FC-AE47-3AE1E59E7BB7,https://fullfact.org/health/boris-johnsons-first-interview-2020-fact-checked/,https://fullfact.org/election-2019/nhs-spending-biggest-boost/,https://fullfact.org/economy/economics-glossary/#:~:text=If%20an%20amount%20of%20money,%E2%80%9Creal%20terms%E2%80%9D%20pay%20rise.,https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-07-07/debates/1C736EA1-AB82-4BE4-81D6-9D2F284BEAB3/Engagements#contribution-630FC374-5980-43EC-A603-37F1237EDAEC,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-hospitalisation-from-delta-variant,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1005517/Technical_Briefing_19.pdf#page=18,https://fullfact.org/online/fully-vaccinated-deaths-daily-expose/,https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmproced/622/622ap28.htm,https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/MemberContributions?memberId=1423&startDate=07%2F23%2F2016%2000%3A00%3A00&endDate=07%2F23%2F2021%2000%3A00%3A00&type=Corrections,https://fullfact.org/news/boris-johnson-whatsapp-covid-life-expectancy-cummings/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/what-has-prime-minister-said-about-booing-england-players/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/times-woke-survey/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/michael-gove-public-first/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/sun-cancel-culture/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Was Dawn Butler right about Boris Johnson ‘lying’ to Parliament?,,,,,,

This is not true. All employees (with a few exceptions) are entitled to statutory sick pay from their employer of £96.35 a week if they are self-isolating (provided the reason for self-isolating isn’t that they have recently returned from abroad). But people are not legally entitled to the equivalent of the living wage (£8.91 an hour for over 23s) while they are self-isolating. Although some employers may of course choose to continue to pay them the living wage while they’re off, as if it were sick leave, and this may be a part of their contractual obligations.  It’s unclear whether Mr Johnson just meant that all employees are entitled to the living wage in general, which is broadly true, except under-23s and apprentices. However, the suggestion that people are entitled to receive the “equivalent” of the living wage while self-isolating, is not. People on low incomes who receive certain benefits, including self-employed people, can also apply for a £500 support payment from their local council.  Some of those who do not receive the right benefits to qualify may get a discretionary payment from their council instead. However, this is an alternative to the support payment, not an additional payment. Nor is “everybody” entitled to it, as the Prime Minister’s comments might have suggested. There is provision for councils to make the £500 payment to people in “extreme circumstances”, but it remains a “discretionary” payment that they are not guaranteed to receive. We have asked Downing Street to clarify Mr Johnson’s comments but at the time of writing it had not responded.","https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/when-to-self-isolate-and-what-to-do/,https://www.gov.uk/employers-sick-pay/eligibility-and-form-ssp1,https://www.gov.uk/employers-sick-pay,https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates,https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme-claiming-financial-support/claiming-financial-support-under-the-test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme-claiming-financial-support/claiming-financial-support-under-the-test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme,https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/coronavirus-getting-benefits-if-youre-self-isolating/,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme-claiming-financial-support/claiming-financial-support-under-the-test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme#:~:text=for%20a%20%C2%A3500-,discretionary,-payment%20if%20all,https://fullfact.org/health/tetanus-risk-social-media/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/robert-peston-reinfections/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/vaccinated-Covid-19-deaths/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/richard-tice-covid-vaccine-infertility-stillbirth/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/charles-walker-youngsters-covid-risk/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Boris Johnson was wrong to say that “everybody” is entitled to extra self-isolation support,,,,,,
13,,,,Mixture,Pippa Allen-Kinross,2021-07-21,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/,Sir Patrick Vallance said 60% of people currently in hospital with Covid-19 were double vaccinated.,2021-07-21,fullfact,,"The government’s Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has corrected comments made at a press conference on 19 July, when he claimed that 60% of people currently in hospital with Covid-19 were double vaccinated.  Writing on Twitter the same evening, he clarified: “About 60% of hospitalisations from covid are not from double vaccinated people, rather 60% of hospitalisations from covid are currently from unvaccinated people.” However, some users on social media are continuing to share the original, incorrect claim without acknowledging the correction in their posts.  The most recent data publicly available from Public Health England, covering the period between 1 February and 21 June 2021, shows there were 1,165 confirmed Delta variant cases where presentation to emergency care resulted in an overnight stay (although this is likely an underestimate). Of these, 733 cases were people who were unvaccinated (63%). Of those who had been vaccinated, 173 cases had received both doses of the vaccine (14.8%), 162 cases had received their first dose of the vaccine more than 21 days ago (13.9%) and 74 had received the first dose less than 21 days ago (6.4%).  As we have written before, none of the Covid-19 vaccines currently available are 100% effective, but vaccines have been found to be highly effective against the risk of hospitalisation. The fact so many people have been vaccinated, and vaccine take up has been very high amongst those most at risk, means it is expected that many people now presenting with Covid in hospitals will have received one or more doses of the vaccine. We welcome Sir Patrick’s correction. It is important that public figures are transparent about errors that they make and issue corrections in a timely manner.","https://youtu.be/3EkYBeoGgV8?t=1544,https://twitter.com/uksciencechief/status/1417204235356213252?s=20,https://www.instagram.com/p/CRjOscMNAiF/,https://www.instagram.com/p/CRhSSlONDC6/?utm_source=ig_embed,https://www.facebook.com/jordan.nixon.946/posts/10224820733767355,https://www.facebook.com/janine.davies.129/posts/10226433634405379,https://www.instagram.com/reel/CRhWEN2hAHT/?utm_source=ig_embed,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1001358/Variants_of_Concern_VOC_Technical_Briefing_18.pdf#page=17,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1001358/Variants_of_Concern_VOC_Technical_Briefing_18.pdf#page=18,https://fullfact.org/online/fully-vaccinated-deaths-daily-expose/,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-hospitalisation-from-delta-variant,https://fullfact.org/online/mandatory-vaccine-care-workers/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/boris-johnson-three-covid-vaccine-pictures/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Double vaccinated people do not make up 60% of Covid-19 hospitalisations,,,,,,
14,,,,False,Sarah Turnnidge,2021-07-21,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/health/richard-tice-covid-vaccine-infertility-stillbirth/,"“Forcing” young women to have Covid-19 vaccines is “almost certain” to lead to increased stillbirths, miscarriages, disabled children and infertility.",2021-07-21,fullfact,,"In a widely shared and now-deleted tweet, Reform UK leader Richard Tice claimed that “forcing” young women to have the Covid-19 vaccine is “almost certain” to lead to “increased stillbirths, miscarriages, disabled children, infertility”. There is no evidence to support this claim. Mr Tice appeared to be reacting to the announcement that people attending nightclubs and other venues where large numbers of people gather in England will need to be fully vaccinated from the end of September.  When asked on Twitter to back up his claim, Mr Tice later cited the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency’s (MHRA) Yellow Card scheme, and a similar programme also used to monitor suspected side effects of vaccines in the US called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).  After being questioned on why he shared inaccurate information about the vaccines, Mr Tice  later deleted the tweet and apologised.  As we have written before, the Yellow Card scheme relies on voluntary reporting from medics and members of the public, and is intended to provide an early warning of any previously unknown risks. An adverse event that occurs after vaccination did not necessarily occur because of it. As the MHRA explains: “The nature of Yellow Card reporting means that reported events are not always proven side effects. Some events may have happened anyway, regardless of vaccination.”  The VAERS site includes a similar caveat, stating: “Healthcare providers, vaccine manufacturers, and the public can submit reports to VAERS. While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness.  “The reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. Most reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they are subject to biases.” Claims that the vaccine can affect a woman’s fertility due to the generation of the spike protein have circulated since the start of the vaccine rollout. As we have written before, there is no evidence this is true.  The latest government data shows that 46 million people in the UK have had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.  The most recent adverse reaction data published by the MHRA shows that there have been six reports of stillbirths after a Covid-19 vaccine, four reports of foetal death, 339 reports of spontaneous abortion (miscarriage), and nine reports of infertility (two male, one female, five unspecified).  As we have written before, it’s sadly estimated one in five pregnancies ends in miscarriage, with an estimated 250,000 miscarriages in the UK each year, so the number of miscarriages reported after vaccination doesn’t appear to exceed the expected level.  Advice from the NHS says there is no evidence that the Covid-19 vaccines affect fertility, and the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have been “widely used during pregnancy in other countries and no safety concerns have been identified.” Evidence reviewed by the MHRA “has raised no specific concerns for safety in pregnancy”. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists states on its website: “Covid-19 vaccines do not contain ingredients that are known to be harmful to pregnant women or to a developing baby.  “Studies of the vaccines in animals to look at the effects on pregnancy have shown no evidence that the vaccine causes harm to the pregnancy or to fertility.” Mr Tice also said the Covid-19 vaccines have “emergency approval only”. All three of the vaccines currently in use in the UK (Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna) have been authorised for use. A fourth, Janssen has been authorised, but is not yet in use.  Across the UK, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has a temporary authorisation (sometimes known as a regulation 174 authorisation) issued by the MHRA, which is an emergency authorisation.  In Great Britain, the Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen vaccines have another type of authorisation, called a “conditional marketing authorisation” which has been issued by the MHRA.  We have written more about the difference between these types of authorisation before.","https://twitter.com/TiceRichard/status/1417173243782475783,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-57893788,https://twitter.com/TiceRichard/status/1417462595175522305,https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/,https://vaers.hhs.gov/,https://twitter.com/TiceRichard/status/1417534451534467073,https://fullfact.org/online/yellow-card-astrazeneca-reactions/#:~:text=REACTIONS-,The%20Yellow%20Card%20scheme,who%20have%20underlying%20illness,-The,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting#summary,https://wonder.cdc.gov/vaers.html#:~:text=Healthcare,scientifically,https://fullfact.org/health/vaccine-covid-fertility/,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/vaccinations,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1003227/COVID-19_Pfizer-BioNTech_Vaccine_Analysis_Print_DLP_07.07.2021.pdf#page=66,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1003228/COVID-19_AstraZeneca_Vaccine_Analysis_Print_DLP_07.07.2021.pdf#page=85,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1003227/COVID-19_Pfizer-BioNTech_Vaccine_Analysis_Print_DLP_07.07.2021.pdf#page=66,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1003227/COVID-19_Pfizer-BioNTech_Vaccine_Analysis_Print_DLP_07.07.2021.pdf#page=66,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1003228/COVID-19_AstraZeneca_Vaccine_Analysis_Print_DLP_07.07.2021.pdf#page=85,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1003230/COVID-19_Moderna_Vaccine_Analysis_Print_DLP_07.07.2021.pdf#page=30,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1003231/COVID-19_Brand_Unspecified_Vaccine_Analysis_Print_DLP_07.07.2021.pdf#page=19,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1003227/COVID-19_Pfizer-BioNTech_Vaccine_Analysis_Print_DLP_07.07.2021.pdf#page=78,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1003228/COVID-19_AstraZeneca_Vaccine_Analysis_Print_DLP_07.07.2021.pdf#page=97,https://fullfact.org/online/Covid-vaccine-miscarriage-false/,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/pregnancy-breastfeeding-fertility-and-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination/,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safety-of-covid-19-vaccines-when-given-in-pregnancy/the-safety-of-covid-19-vaccines-when-given-in-pregnancy,https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/coronavirus-covid-19-pregnancy-and-womens-health/covid-19-vaccines-and-pregnancy/covid-19-vaccines-pregnancy-and-breastfeeding/,https://fullfact.org/online/car-multiclaim-video/#:~:text=All%20three,authorisation%20before,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/information-for-uk-recipients-on-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/conditions-of-authorisation-for-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca#history,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-janssen,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-vaccines/,https://fullfact.org/health/tetanus-risk-social-media/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/robert-peston-reinfections/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/vaccinated-Covid-19-deaths/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/self-isolation-support/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/charles-walker-youngsters-covid-risk/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Richard Tice makes misleading claims about Covid-19 vaccines and fertility,,,,,,

This is not true. Although the risks of Covid-19 to young people are very low, it is not right to say that they face no risk at all. In England and Wales, since the pandemic started, 237 people under the age of 30 have died with Covid mentioned on their death certificates as either an underlying or contributory cause. Within this group, the risk is higher among those old enough to go to nightclubs. A small number of young people also become seriously ill with Covid, even if they do not die. The latest data from England, Wales and Northern Ireland suggests that since September about 2.9% of hospital patients critically ill with Covid were younger than 30. There also appears to be a risk of ‘long Covid’, when symptoms last for a long time, although the size of this risk is currently difficult to quantify.","https://medium.com/wintoncentre/what-have-been-the-fatal-risks-of-covid-particularly-to-children-and-younger-adults-a5cbf7060c49,https://twitter.com/zorinaq/status/1406714693507375106?s=20,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/weeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/weeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2770542/#:~:text=Young%20adults%20age%2018%20to%2034%20years%20hospitalized%20with%20COVID-19%20experienced%20substantial%20rates%20of%20adverse%20outcomes%3A%2021%25%20required%20intensive%20care%2C%2010%25%20required%20mechanical%20ventilation%2C%20and%202.7%25%20died.,https://www.icnarc.org/our-audit/audits/cmp/reports,https://www.icnarc.org/our-audit/audits/cmp/reports,https://www.icnarc.org/our-audit/audits/cmp/reports,https://www.icnarc.org/our-audit/audits/cmp/reports,https://fullfact.org/health/extrapolating-figures-around-long-covid-kids-not-way-go/,https://fullfact.org/health/tetanus-risk-social-media/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/robert-peston-reinfections/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/vaccinated-Covid-19-deaths/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/self-isolation-support/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/richard-tice-covid-vaccine-infertility-stillbirth/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Young people do face a small risk from Covid,,,,,,

On Sunday, 18 July, it was announced that, as part of this pilot, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor were not required to self-isolate after coming into contact with the health secretary Sajid Javid, who then tested positive for Covid-19. This decision was later reversed and both are now self-isolating.  After accusations that the government had received preferential treatment, ministers including Robert Jenrick and Nadhim Zahawi stressed that the pilot scheme included other participants including TfL, and not just the government. TfL, however, responded suggesting it was not part of the trial and was “waiting for formal notification from [the government] that we are part of this trial.” The head of the RMT trade union said: “For the government to claim there is an agreed scheme or system is totally untrue.” But the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) told us that TfL currently have two sites registered as part of the pilot And a TfL spokesperson later confirmed: “We have been part of a limited location-based trial at two sites which allows staff who have been notified by Test & Trace to take a lateral flow test at one of these sites on seven consecutive days and continue working throughout if negative.” The two locations included its own main office in Southwark, as well as King’s Cross station.  DHSC said that the trial has been running since December among organisations in England with workplace testing sites, and that Downing Street joined the trial in May.  TfL confirmed that when it said it was “waiting for formal notification from them that we are part of this trial”, it had been referring to a different trial, whereby employees can take tests at home instead of self-isolating, after being told to do so by NHS Test & Trace.","https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-57877373,https://news.sky.com/story/pm-and-sunak-not-isolating-despite-being-pinged-after-javids-positive-covid-test-12358198,https://twitter.com/RidgeOnSunday/status/1416735259740225536,https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000y35m/breakfast-19072021,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/18/unions-deny-rail-and-tube-staff-in-scheme-to-skip-self-isolation,https://fullfact.org/health/tetanus-risk-social-media/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/robert-peston-reinfections/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/vaccinated-Covid-19-deaths/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/self-isolation-support/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/richard-tice-covid-vaccine-infertility-stillbirth/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",TfL is part of self-isolation pilot scheme,,,,,,

The median age is 82 - 81 for men 85 for women.  “That is above life expectancy. So get Covid and live longer.”  While Downing Street has denied other claims made by Mr Cummings, they have so far not denied that the message was sent by Mr Johnson. The idea that people who die of Covid have lived longer than average fails to appreciate these are the very people who would have been expected to live much longer. As we have written before, people dying of Covid lose about a decade of life, on average. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) does not regularly publish information on the average age of Covid-19 deaths but, as we have written before, a response to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request published in January 2021 shows that between the week ending 9 October, 2020, and the week ending 1 January, 2021, the median age of deaths involving Covid-19 was 83.  Data published through a different FOI request to the ONS shows that the median age of Covid-19 deaths in England and Wales, up to and including 2 October, 2020, was also 83. According to the most recent statistics from the ONS, the average life expectancy at birth in the UK from 2017 to 2019 was 79.4 years for males and 83.1 years for females.  This would appear to show that the message attributed to Mr Johnson was correct—but it is not how life expectancy works in reality.  Life expectancy is an average, which means it is pulled down by people who die young. It also means that life expectancy increases as you age.  A set of data called the National Life Tables, produced by the ONS, shows how life expectancy adjusts as a person ages.  An 82-year-old man can expect to live for another 7.4 years on average, while an 85-year-old woman can expect to live another 6.87 years on average.  People dying of Covid in their 80s before they otherwise would have died, itself reduces average life expectancy.  The idea that you can ‘get Covid and live longer’ fails to take this into account, and therefore misunderstands the impact of Covid-19 deaths.","https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-57854811#:~:text=the%20%22median%20age%22%20for%20those%20dying%20was%20between%2081%20and%2082%20for%20men%20and%2085%20for%20women%2C%20the%20prime%20minister%20allegedly%20wrote%2C%20adding%3A%20%22that%20is%20above%20life%20expectancy.%20so%20get%20covid%20and%20live%20longer.,https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/1417397768931401754,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-57854811#:~:text=downing%20street%20denied%20that%20this%20incident%20took%20place%20and%20buckingham%20palace%20declined%20to%20comment.],https://fullfact.org/health/covid19-behind-the-death-toll/#:~:text=people%20dying%20of%20covid%20have%20still%20lost%20about%20a%20decade%20of%20life%2C%20on%20average.,https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-75,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-cremation-pcr-asymptomatic-transmission/#:~:text=The%20ONS%20does,was%20also%2083,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/adhocs/12773averageageofdeathmedianandmeanofpersonswhosedeathwasduetocovid19orinvolvedcovid19bysexdeathsregisteredinweekending9october2020toweekending1january2021englandandwales,https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/freedomofinformationfoi/averageageofthosewhohaddiedwithcovid19,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/bulletins/nationallifetablesunitedkingdom/2017to2019#:~:text=life%20expectancy%20at%20birth%20in%20the%20uk%20in%202017%20to%202019%20was%2079.4%20years%20for%20males%20and%2083.1%20years%20for%20females,https://www.covid-arg.com/post/get-covid-and-live-longer#:~:text=above-,life%20expectancy%20is%20an,at%20least%2080%20years,-The,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/bulletins/nationallifetablesunitedkingdom/2017to2019#:~:text=national%20life%20tables%3A%20uk%20dataset%20%7C%20released%2024%20september%202020,https://fullfact.org/news/dawn-butler-boris-johnson-lying/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/what-has-prime-minister-said-about-booing-england-players/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/times-woke-survey/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/michael-gove-public-first/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/sun-cancel-culture/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Average Covid-19 victim dies years before they otherwise would,,,,,,
21,,,,Mixture,Grace Rahman,2021-07-20,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/,"There have been 1,400 deaths and one million injured from Covid-19 vaccinations in the UK.",2021-07-20,fullfact,,"The front page of free newspaper ‘The Light’, shared on Facebook, claimed that there have been 1,400 deaths and a million injuries “from covid injections” in the UK. There have been just over 1,470 deaths following a Covid-19 vaccination in the UK, according to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency’s (MHRA) Yellow Card reporting scheme, as of 7 July 2020. These deaths aren’t necessarily caused by the vaccine though. The MHRA says: “Vaccination and surveillance of large populations means that, by chance, some people will experience and report a new illness or events in the days and weeks after vaccination.  “A high proportion of people vaccinated early in the vaccination campaign were very elderly, and/or had pre-existing medical conditions. Older age and chronic underlying illnesses make it more likely that coincidental adverse events will occur, especially given the millions of people vaccinated.” The MHRA has identified a possible link between a type of extremely rare blood clot occurring with low levels of platelets and the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. There have been 74 fatal cases of this following this vaccination as of 7 July. There have been just over a million suspected reactions reported as of 7 July. Again, these adverse reactions weren’t definitely caused by the vaccination, but were reported afterwards, either by the individual themselves or a healthcare professional. Not all of these were serious “injuries”, as The Light describes them. For example, there were over 14,000 reported suspected side effects of fatigue following the Pfizer vaccine. The main body of The Light’s front page text, which is blurry in the Facebook picture, goes on to say: “More than 1400 deaths have been reported following covid injections in the UK”. This is technically correct but, as said, the fact a death is reported following a vaccination is no proof the vaccine was the cause.","https://thelightpaper.co.uk/assets/pdf/The-Light-11D-Miki-FINAL.pdf,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158628780561795&set=a.493612736794&type=3,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1003414/Coronavirus_vaccine_-_summary_of_Yellow_Card_reporting_07.07.2021_-_Clean.pdf#page=17,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1003414/Coronavirus_vaccine_-_summary_of_Yellow_Card_reporting_07.07.2021_-_Clean.pdf#page=17,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mhra-issues-new-advice-concluding-a-possible-link-between-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-and-extremely-rare-unlikely-to-occur-blood-clots,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1003414/Coronavirus_vaccine_-_summary_of_Yellow_Card_reporting_07.07.2021_-_Clean.pdf#page=9,https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/about,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1003227/COVID-19_Pfizer-BioNTech_Vaccine_Analysis_Print_DLP_07.07.2021.pdf#page=22,https://fullfact.org/online/mandatory-vaccine-care-workers/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/boris-johnson-three-covid-vaccine-pictures/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Free paper repeats falsehoods on deaths following vaccination,,,,,,

25,,,,False,Abbas Panjwani,2021-07-20,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/economy/george-freeman-africa-eu-tariffs/,The EU has a 40% tariff on food from Africa.,2021-07-20,fullfact,,"Following the government’s decision to reduce its commitment to spend 0.7% of Gross National Income on foreign aid to 0.5%, Conservative MP George Freeman appeared on Newsnight to talk about the other ways in which the government supported poorer nations. One thing he claimed was that the UK had reduced the EU’s 40% tariff on food imports from Africa. It was something he previously said in Parliament in April. But the EU doesn’t have a 40% tariff on food from Africa.  Tariffs are taxes on imports. They are largely used to protect domestic producers from foreign competition. For example, if a government wanted to protect domestic beef farmers from being undercut by foreign competitors, it might choose to place a tariff on foreign imports of beef. The EU has tariffs on various products, but there isn’t just one flat 40% tariff on food. Tariffs vary by foodstuff. For instance, the average tariff placed on dairy products imported into the EU is 37% while on tea and coffee it’s 6%.  In practice there are many different products within each of these categories which have their own specific tariff.  But what’s more important, is that the EU waives most tariffs on the majority of African countries.  By our count, 43 of 55 African countries face no tariffs whatsoever when exporting to the EU, with the exception of arms. This is because of schemes where the EU unilaterally waives tariffs on the least developed nations worldwide, or bilateral “economic partnership agreements”, where the EU drops its import tariffs, often in exchange for better access to the other signatory country’s market.  Another eight African countries face either reduced or removed tariffs on most exports to the EU, by virtue of schemes the EU has to help low and lower-middle income countries, or free trade agreements.  Goods originating from Western Sahara are subject to the same terms as goods from Morocco which claims the area (a free trade agreement with some tariffs on fish and agri-foods) .   Only three countries in Africa do not have preferential trading terms with the EU: Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Libya.  Going back to Mr Freeman’s original claim, there may well be a particular foodstuff from the continent which the EU charges an import tariff of 40% on, and which the UK does not. And that may mean that exporters from those 12 countries without complete tariff free access to the EU face lower tariff barriers exporting that product to the UK than the EU. But that’s hardly the same as saying that the EU puts a 40% tariff on food imports from Africa. After publication Mr Freeman acknowledged the statistic was incorrect.","https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-sets-out-conditions-for-returning-to-07-aid-target,https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000xwmw/newsnight-13072021,https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-04-13/debates/9158B8BB-DBAE-4495-86F7-57A3C5B05CD2/Finance(No2)Bill#contribution-27E3A907-13A5-46A1-9875-A89DCF05C156,https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/trade-tariffs#:~:text=What%20are%20tariffs%20and%20why,domestic%20industries%20from%20foreign%20competition.,https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/statis_e/daily_update_e/tariff_profiles/CE_E.pdf,https://africacheck.org/fact-checks/reports/how-many-countries-africa-how-hard-can-question-be,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17kCrdVtZr8ziSFFA0EeVJ0QGCYNWV7rXgx23Li88R-A/edit?usp=sharing,https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/development/generalised-scheme-of-preferences/,https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/development/economic-partnerships/index_en.htm,https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/october/tradoc_152818.pdf,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17kCrdVtZr8ziSFFA0EeVJ0QGCYNWV7rXgx23Li88R-A/edit?usp=sharing,https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/development/generalised-scheme-of-preferences/index_en.htm,https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2017/november/tradoc_156399.pdf,https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2019.034.01.0004.01.ENG,https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/internationalrelations/2021/05/04/eu-western-sahara/,https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2017/november/tradoc_156399.pdf,https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/regions/central-africa/index_en.htm,https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/libya/index_en.htm,https://twitter.com/GeorgeFreemanMP/status/1417950084017397760,https://fullfact.org/economy/millionaire-pensioners/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/economy/april-2021-trade-figures/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/economy/uk-foreign-aid-g7/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/economy/labours-record-on-unemployment/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/economy/foreign-aid-2021/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",The EU doesn’t have a 40% tariff on African food imports,,,,,,

On 12 July, French president Emmanuel Macron announced new measures against Covid-19, including the introduction of Covid-19 ‘passports’ and that vaccination will become mandatory for all health workers.  The planned new measures have led to large protests in the country. Reuters reported that there were 137 protests across France on 17 July, gathering nearly 114,000 people. Of these protestors, 18,000 were in Paris, according to the French government.  However, this photograph, which appears to show far more than 18,000 people, was not taken during these protests. A reverse image search shows this photograph was used by multiple news outlets reporting on France’s victory in the 2018 World Cup.

Other text accompanying the image adds “Actually lower”. Firstly, it’s true that death rates are lower than previous years, at least in England and Wales. To measure this we can use the age-standardised mortality rate which is the number of deaths per 100,000 people, adjusted to even out the changing age structure of the country over time. As of May 2021, the rate is at its lowest since records began in 2001. Mortality rates have been broadly declining since 2001. However, the Facebook post seems to be suggesting that lower death rates indicate that Covid-19 is not killing anyone or perhaps that it does not exist. Using the same data we can see the age-standardised mortality rate in May 2020 (near the peak of the pandemic in England) was at its highest level for both men and women since 2007. Looking back further to April 2020, mortality rates were then at their highest since the Office for National Statistics’ mortality records began. While deaths are lower now compared to the same time last year, owed in part to the vaccination programme, people are still dying from Covid-19.  Hundreds of people are also still being infected and hospitalised every day. We’ve fact checked similar claims before.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10225170874115640&set=a.10209627838189456&type=3&theater,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/monthlymortalityanalysisenglandandwales/may2021,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/monthlymortalityanalysisenglandandwales/may2021,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/monthlymortalityanalysisenglandandwales/april2021,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/healthcare,https://fullfact.org/online/death-rate-2020-2003/,https://fullfact.org/online/mandatory-vaccine-care-workers/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/boris-johnson-three-covid-vaccine-pictures/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",A fall in death rates doesn’t prove Covid-19 isn’t killing anyone,,,,,,
28,,,,Other,Tom Norton,2021-07-16,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/online/Allison-Pearson-Covid-stats-hospital/,The number of Covid hospitalisations is 0.5% of the level of cases.,2021-07-16,fullfact,,"Columnist Allison Pearson tweeted on Monday that only 0.5% of patients with Covid-19 have been hospitalised, looking at the recent weekly average of cases and hospitalisations. This is a misleading calculation to make because of the lag between cases and hospitalisations, and, regardless, the calculation has been done incorrectly. It's unclear but it appears Ms Pearson was looking at the data for England. When she tweeted, the seven-day average daily case count was around 26,000 (taken on 4 July). She compares this with the seven-day average of patients admitted to hospital with Covid-19 (which was 444 on 7 July, the latest data when she tweeted).

This claim is not proven. Cancer Research UK says that “there is no reliable evidence to use [Rife machines] as a treatment for cancer”. RIFE machines were created in the 1920-30s by the scientist Raymond Rife, and they work by omitting low electromagnetic energy waves. Supporters of the machine say that all medical conditions have an electromagnetic frequency, and by matching the frequency, the RIFE machine can kill or disable affected cells.  RIFE machines are not an established treatment in the UK (or in other countries such as the US), as there is no reliable evidence to say that they work and they have not been through the rigorous testing required for a treatment to be used.  Cancer Research UK says: “Many websites promote the Rife machine as a cure for cancer. But no reputable scientific cancer organisations support any of these claims.” It also says there is no evidence that these machines do not cause harm to people who use them, and warns: “You could harm your health if you stop your cancer treatment for an unproven treatment.” There are some studies which have explored the use of low energy waves as a treatment for cancer, but further research in this area is required.  There are cancer treatments which use high frequency sound waves to kill cancer cells, and these have a good evidence base for their use.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=173655694783084&set=a.125066426308678&type=3&theater,https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/rife-machine-and-cancer,https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.3322/canjclin.44.2.115#page=5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8124604/,https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/rife-machine-and-cancer#:~:text=The%20Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration,machines%20against%20making%20unproven%20claims.,https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/rife-machine-and-cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3097732/,https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/rife-machine-and-cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3261663/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26762464/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3845545/#b11,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5119968/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3188936/,https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/other/high-intensity-focused-ultrasound-hifu,https://fullfact.org/health/tetanus-risk-social-media/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/robert-peston-reinfections/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/vaccinated-Covid-19-deaths/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/self-isolation-support/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/richard-tice-covid-vaccine-infertility-stillbirth/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",No evidence Rife machines can cure all cancers,,,,,,

It is based on a report produced by the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ), which states that during September to December 2020, 93,514 pupils in England were severely absent, which means they missed school more often than they attended. This does not include pupils who missed lessons directly due to Covid-19, for example, school bubble closures. As the figure is now quite old, it tells us nothing about attendance during the spring and summer terms so it is not accurate to say that “nearly 100,000 children have failed to return to school full-time since they reopened [our emphasis]”, as stated in the article. The phrasing that these children “have not returned to school” is also problematic. The CSJ found 100,000 children attended less than 50% of available sessions in the autumn term, not that they weren’t present at school at all.  Finally, the idea that these children have failed to “return” is inaccurate, in suggesting that these children (or this many equivalent children) were regularly attending school before the pandemic, which is not the case.  Even before Covid-19, in the autumn term of 2019, 60,244 pupils were classed as severely absent. The number of severely absent children has risen by more than 50% in a year, a significant increase, but it’s important to bear in mind that the factors contributing to the absence of a large number of these children may not be related to, or at least dependent on, Covid-19.","https://www.standard.co.uk/news/education/school-absence-children-covid-pandemic-b945551.html?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1626187865-1,https://fullfact.org/education/school-pupils-return-classroom-covid/,https://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Cant_Catch_Up_FULL-REPORT.pdf#page=3,https://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Cant_Catch_Up_FULL-REPORT.pdf#page=7,https://www.standard.co.uk/news/education/school-absence-children-covid-pandemic-b945551.html?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#:~:text=nearly%20100%2C000%20children%20have%20failed%20to%20return%20to%20school%20full-time%20since%20they%20reopened.,https://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Cant_Catch_Up_FULL-REPORT.pdf#page=3,https://fullfact.org/education/maria-miller-nine-ten-girls-ofsted/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/education/ofsted-sexual-abuse-schools/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/education/school-pupils-return-classroom-covid/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/education/literacy-numeracy-uk-telegraph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/education/pupil-funding-conservatives/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content","Figure of 100,000 children missing from school is out of date",,,,,,

Beneath the image are the names of the former presidents of Haiti (Jovenel Moïse), Tanzania (John Magufuli) and Zambia (Kenneth Kaunda).  The posts suggest that the death of these three men is linked to a refusal of the Covid-19 vaccines. There is no evidence to support this claim.  Haiti is eligible for provision of Covid-19 vaccines through the Covax programme, but roll out has been slow, with Haiti yet to give any doses to residents, and only receiving its first vaccines this week.   President Moïse did not explicitly refuse all of the Covid-19 vaccines, but the country did initially refuse the AstraZeneca vaccine due to safety concerns.   There have also been administrative and supply difficulties around the arrival of vaccinations to Haiti, and concerns about the logistics of organising the vaccine roll out.  Mr Moïse was fatally shot at home on 7 July 2021. Arrests have been made but there are still many unknown details about the assasination. There is no evidence to suggest that there is a link to the lack of progress made regarding Haiti’s vaccine roll out.  President Magufuli reportedly said that home treatments such as steam inhalation were preferable to “dangerous foreign vaccines”, and in February 2021 the country’s health minister said that Tanzania had no plans to accept Covid-19 vaccines.   Mr Magufuli’s successor,  president Samia Suluhu Hassan announced that the president’s death in March 2021 was due to heart disease. There is no evidence to suggest that the death was related to Mr Magufuli’s stance on the Covid-19 vaccines.  There has been some speculation from Tanzanian opposition leaders, and on social media, that Mr Magufuli’s death may have been caused by Covid-19, however this has been discredited.  President Kaunda died of pneumonia at a military hospital in Lusaka in June 2021, age 97. The president did not refuse the Covid-19 vaccines for Zambia. In fact, in March 2021, the Zambian health minister announced plans to vaccinate all over 18s in the country.

Male wolves never attack a female, and she knows it. Why does she hide then? By doing this, the resourceful female protects her partner’s throat against an attack”.  This narrative is untrue. The image, ‘wolf fight’, was taken by photographer Jean Paul and uploaded to Flickr in 2009. It shows three wolves, two of which appear about to fight. The third wolf is cowering beneath one of the fighting wolves’ heads and is covering its neck. The caption says that the image was taken in Ely, Minnesota. The claim attached to the image on Facebook—that one of the wolves is female, and is using her stance to protect a male wolf's neck—appears to come from a post on Reddit in 2016.  Fact checkers Snopes, previously spoke to wolf expert Cameron Feaster at the International Wolf Center in Ely who said that “little of anything in that photo’s statement is correct.”  Mr Feaster was familiar with the wolves, and said none of the three shown in the image are female. He also said that the crouching wolf was simply submitting and trying to turn back, and collided into another male wolf.  Rather than showing a female wolf protecting the neck of her male partner, the photograph simply shows a collision between two male wolves as one tries to flee.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2639763119652582&set=gm.979222356242137&type=3&theater,https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeanpaulphotos/3409921252,https://www.reddit.com/r/wolves/comments/4esyro/the_female_wolf_appears_to_hide_under_the/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/wolf-fight-female-throat/,https://wolf.org/wolf-log/feeding-time/,https://wolf.org/visit/hours-fees-programs/,https://fullfact.org/online/mandatory-vaccine-care-workers/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/boris-johnson-three-covid-vaccine-pictures/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content","Image shows a retreating wolf, not a protector",,,,,,

Public health authorities do monitor these reports to see if there may be genuine issues associated with vaccination, and this has uncovered issues such as a link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots.    But the US Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC) says these ”reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness.” Some of the reports submitted include things we know can be a result of vaccination, such as fatigue and headaches.  The most recent data shows 438,441 reports detailing 1,919,081 adverse events have been submitted to the CDC following a Covid-19 vaccine, up until 2 July 2021. A small number of these reports come from outside the United States.   The USA’s Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) is similar to the UK’s Yellow Card scheme, which we have written about before.","https://www.facebook.com/Dawn.Jesusismylife/posts/1447389282284898,https://fullfact.org/health/VAERS-reporting-america/,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting,https://vaers.hhs.gov/data.html,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/safety-and-side-effects/,https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D8/D185F526,https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D8/D185F540,https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html,https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/,https://fullfact.org/online/MHRA-yellow-card-poster/,https://fullfact.org/online/police-station-video/,https://fullfact.org/online/mandatory-vaccine-care-workers/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/boris-johnson-three-covid-vaccine-pictures/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Adverse event reports after vaccines are not necessarily due to vaccines,,,,,,

In fact this is a picture of “Stone 60”, which is ancient like the rest, but was reinforced with concrete in 1959.  The other pictures show people working on the site with various pieces of scaffolding and equipment. The video captions say: “These are just props… Created in the 1950s… Then Faked old pictures from the 1800s… To fool the masses… ‘His-story’ is a lie... We are now learning the mainstream narrative of history was completely fabricated!” A post accompanying the video claims something slightly different, saying: “They built the fake Stonehenge in the 1800's”. In fact, these pictures simply show the stones being restored at various times in history. Stonehenge was built in stages, between 5,000 and 4,500 years ago.

One of the posts shows a lemon with a positive result, which it claims is evidence of the tests producing multiple false positives, while the other shows ‘positive’ results next to a tomato, a raspberry and a blackberry. However, as we’ve established before, foods high in acid break lateral flow tests, causing it to appear like a positive result. The fact that these tests can effectively be broken with fruit does not make them inaccurate or unreliable for use in the general population.  Lateral flow tests are unlikely to give a false positive result if used correctly. We have previously fact checked, among others, claims that kiwi fruit, Coca Cola, ketchup, fruit squash, strawberries, grapes, oranges and diluted cordial have incorrectly produced “positive” results.  Using food and drinks on lateral flow tests has been in the news after reports that pupils are attempting to get time off school by using liquids like lemon juice to create false positive results.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=175025971311811&set=a.108946811253061&type=3,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=4779371318745742&set=a.178099415539645&type=3,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=4779371318745742&set=a.178099415539645&type=3,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=175025971311811&set=a.108946811253061&type=3,https://fullfact.org/online/orange-covid-positive/,https://www.apr.cz/data/uploads/covid-19/cpr_05_diaquick-covid-19-ag-cassette_2020-09-18.pdf,https://en.joysbio.com/covid-19-antigen-rapid-test-kit/,https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Options-use-of-rapid-antigen-tests-for-COVID-19.pdf#page=4,https://fullfact.org/online/kiwi-covid/,https://fullfact.org/online/ketchup-squash-fruit/,https://fullfact.org/online/orange-covid-positive/,https://fullfact.org/online/lateral-flow-tests-cordial/,https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/tiktok-fake-covid-positive-test-schools-1079693,https://fullfact.org/online/mandatory-vaccine-care-workers/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/boris-johnson-three-covid-vaccine-pictures/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Acidic foods don’t test positive for Covid,,,,,,

42,,,,False,Daniella de Block Golding,2021-07-14,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/online/graphene-oxide/,The Pfizer vaccine is 99% graphene oxide.,2021-07-14,fullfact,,"There have been multiple claims made online which say that the Pfizer vaccine contains 99% graphene oxide, a substance which is derived from graphite. The claims originate from a Spanish study and have been circulating in English (across the UK and the US), in Spanish and in Portugese. They are not true. Some of the claims highlight concerns about the toxicity of graphene oxide, while others suggest that graphene oxide may provide an explanation for the ‘magnetism’ that has been commonly claimed to be associated with the Covid-19 vaccines (this is false and we have fact checked this claim previously).  In addition to seeing posts shared on social media, Full Fact has also been asked about these claims by our own readers. Several users on social media have claimed graphene oxide in the vaccine is being used to poison people and create a mass genocide. This is not true, and there is no graphene oxide in the Pfizer vaccine. Graphene oxide is a nanomaterial (a chemical substance or material that is at a very small scale, for example with an external dimension of 1-100nm) which is thought to be of important potential use for biomedicine. There are concerns, however, around toxicity and potential adverse effects. There are modifications which are being explored, and Johns Hopkins infectious disease specialist Dr. Amesh Adalja previously told AP News that there has been research on potentially using graphene oxide in other vaccines, but the amounts would not be toxic to human cells. The concern around the presence of graphene oxide in the Pfizer vaccine seem to be based on a Spanish study which says that on transmission electron microscopy (a microscopy technique which allows particularly fine details and structures to be seen), the solution created from a vial of the Pfizer vaccine takes a very similar form to graphene oxide.  Graphene oxide is not listed as an ingredient of the vaccine, and the Medical and Health product Regulatory Agency (MHRA)  told Full Fact that these claims are “completely incorrect”.  A spokesperson for Pfizer also told Full Fact that “Graphene oxide is not used in the manufacture of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine”. With regards to the Spanish study, there are a number of problems with the claims that it makes, and the way that these findings have been interpreted by some people on social media.  The claim that the Pfizer vaccine is largely made up of graphene oxide has been fact checked many times before.    Firstly, we have no way of verifying what the scientists actually looked at through electron microscopy. The paper says that the sample of Pfizer vaccine for testing was received by the testing laboratory from a courier and, although the sample was sealed, its provenance and traceability is unknown. The author says in the study limitations that these findings are from “one single sample” of Pfizer vaccine and therefore, “significant sampling of similar vials” is required in order to “draw conclusions that can be generalized”.    When referring to the images which compare electron microscopy of the Pfizer vaccine with images of microscopy of graphene oxide, the study says that they “represent a high similarity” but also says that this does not provide “definitive identification” or “conclusive evidence”.  Importantly, the document says that it is an interim report. It has not been published in a reputable scientific journal, or received peer review.  Thirdly, while the researcher who authors the paper reportedly works at the University of Almeria in Spain—a claim that has been used to add legitimacy when circulated online—the author clearly states that the results and conclusions of the report “do not imply any institutional position of the University of Almeria”.  The university has also publicly distanced itself from the paper on Twitter and in a released statement, saying that it is an “unofficial report by a university professor about an analysis of a sample of unknown origin with total lack of traceability”.  The university said it does not subscribe to this report.","https://roguemale.org/2021/07/07/murder-by-injection-the-vile-vials/?fbclid=IwAR17MwbuL8YLrZ3M_YToUeQVeuIEfHHGcjCq5VRd09tR4VV8x4q21t6CPr4,https://truth11.com/2021/06/30/no-biological-content-in-pfizer-vaccine-spanish-researchers-put-the-pfizer-vaccine-under-an-electron-microscope-and-found-it-contains-99-graphene-oxide-and-hardly-anything-else/,https://www.henrymakow.com/2021/06/no-biological-content-in-pfize.html,https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/graphene-oxide,https://www.docdroid.net/rNgtxyh/microscopia-de-vial-corminaty-dr-campra-firma-e-1-fusionado-pdf#page=16,https://www.globalresearch.ca/actual-contents-inside-pfizer-vials-exposed/5749458,https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20210704/analizamos-bulo-grafeno-vacuna-informe/2119721.shtml,https://observador.pt/factchecks/fact-check-vacinas-contem-grafeno-na-sua-composicao/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-vaccine-magnet/,https://www.instagram.com/p/CQsk4_SNWEO/?utm_source=ig_embed,https://www.facebook.com/oluwole.adebiyi/videos/vb.1360171672/1111292026061642/?type=2&theater,https://www.instagram.com/reel/CRBnSVVAgPO/?utm_source=ig_embed,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=345722947084202&set=pcb.553492665657573&type=3&theater,https://www.instagram.com/reel/CRBnSVVAgPO/?utm_source=ig_embed,https://www.facebook.com/oluwole.adebiyi/videos/vb.1360171672/1111292026061642/?type=2&theater,https://www.safenano.org/knowledgebase/resources/faqs/what-is-a-nanomaterial/,https://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/nanotech/faq/definition_en.htm,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20210520/Could-graphene-oxide-nanosheets-be-an-effective-SARS-CoV-2-antiviral-in-PPE.aspx,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.202101483,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1742706120303305,https://www.pnas.org/content/118/19/e2024998118,https://particleandfibretoxicology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12989-016-0168-y,https://www.pnas.org/content/118/19/e2024998118,https://www.graphene-info.com/graphene-oxide-gives-boost-new-intranasal-flu-vaccine,https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-430816913228,https://www.docdroid.net/Ov1M99x/official-interim-report-in-english-university-of-almeria-pdf#page=8,https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/current/postgraduate/regs/mpagswarwick/ex5/techniques/structural/tem/,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/summary-of-product-characteristics-for-covid-19-vaccine-pfizerbiontech,https://www.newtral.es/grafeno-vacuna-pfizer-universidad-almeria-bulo/20210702/,https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/there-is-no-conclusive-evidence-that-the-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-contains-graphene-oxide/,https://maldita.es/malditaciencia/20210709/informe-universidad-almeria-vacuna-covid-19-pfizer-grafeno-oxido/,https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20210704/analizamos-bulo-grafeno-vacuna-informe/2119721.shtml,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2021/07/10/graphene-oxide-in-pfizer-covid-19-vaccines-here-are-the-latest-unsupported-claims/?sh=2301198974d7,https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-430816913228?fbclid=IwAR2PeKAzhQNulH_xFDS5BAac4YGQ4vXw2DRLwBfsSmuG1dx2Yj5EGTFBsZg,https://www.docdroid.net/rNgtxyh/microscopia-de-vial-corminaty-dr-campra-firma-e-1-fusionado-pdf#page=3,https://www.docdroid.net/rNgtxyh/microscopia-de-vial-corminaty-dr-campra-firma-e-1-fusionado-pdf#page=22,https://www.docdroid.net/rNgtxyh/microscopia-de-vial-corminaty-dr-campra-firma-e-1-fusionado-pdf,https://twitter.com/ualmeria/status/1410884237377560579?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1410884237377560579%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fhealthfeedback.org%2Fclaimreview%2Fthere-is-no-conclusive-evidence-that-the-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-contains-graphene-oxide%2F,https://www.newtral.es/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/COMUNICADO-DE-LA-UNIVERSIDAD-DE-ALMERI%CC%81A_2-julio-2021_def.pdf?x32658,https://fullfact.org/online/mandatory-vaccine-care-workers/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/boris-johnson-three-covid-vaccine-pictures/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",The

43,,,,True,Leo Benedictus,2021-07-14,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/education/maria-miller-nine-ten-girls-ofsted/,Nine in 10 school-age girls are being sent explicit images.,2021-07-14,fullfact,,"During Prime Minister’s Questions last week, and on Twitter, the Conservative MP Maria Miller misinterpreted recent Ofsted research on sexual abuse in schools. As we have said before, based on evidence from a variety of sources, it seems very likely that sexual harassment and abuse are a common problem among schoolchildren, and especially among girls. However, the Ofsted survey does not tell us how common the problem is. Ofsted visited 32 schools and colleges, which it specifically said “should not be assumed to be a fully representative sample of all schools and colleges nationally.” During these visits, inspectors asked students to complete a questionnaire, which showed them a list of different types of abusive behaviour and asked: “How often do these things happen between people of your age”. (This is slightly different from the wording that Ofsted originally told us it had used.) Roughly nine out of 10 girls (88%) said that “being sent pictures or videos they did not want to see” happened “a lot” or “sometimes”. However, they were not answering a question about what happened to them. The question was whether people their age are sent pictures or videos that they do not want to see. It’s unclear how students might have interpreted that in their answers so we can’t say that the figure refers to the number of girls, or even students, that this has happened to. Ms Miller’s office told us that her claim was based on Ofsted’s press statement and its review. We subsequently explained why Ofsted’s statement and review did not support Ms Miller’s claim. She has now added a clarification to her original tweet. Ms Miller is by no means the only person who misinterpreted Ofsted’s research. As we said in our original fact check, the i, Mirror, Metro, Times, Telegraph, Mail, BBC and ITV all made the same mistake in their reporting. The day after we published our first fact check, the BBC amended its article and added a clarification. The fact that many people misunderstood Ofsted’s research in the same way suggests that its press statement and review were not easy for others to understand correctly. We contacted Ofsted to ask whether it planned to clarify the press release or reach out to news outlets to correct these mistakes.
