Verdict: False While farmers in Denmark are not required to plant flowers for bees, they can voluntarily dedicate a portion of their land to growing crops meant to boost biodiversity in exchange for a grant. Fact Check:   There are 292 known bee species in Denmark, 56 of which were found to be “threatened,” according to an article published in the Public Library of Science. Now, a July 25 image on Facebook shows what appears to be a field of wildflowers. The text accompanying the image reads: “In Denmark, farmers are required by law to grow field flowers for the bees in 5% of the country.” There is, however, no evidence of such a law. Check Your Fact reviewed Denmark’s environmental law and found no mention of farmers having to plant flowers for bees. A search of the Danish Agricultural Agency’s website likewise showed no evidence of the law. (RELATED: Does This Image Show The World’s Smallest Bird Species?) While there isn’t a law requiring farmers to dedicate any portion of their land to grow field flowers for bees, the European Commission has an initiative called the “green direct payment,” which rewards “farmers who adopt or maintain farming practices that help meet environmental and climate goals,” according to the European Commission’s website. Farmers can receive payment through this program if they plant a variety of crops, have permanent grassland and “dedicate 5% of arable land to areas beneficial for biodiversity,” the program’s guidelines state. Since Denmark is part of the EU, Danish farmers are eligible for the grant.  “The Danish government follows the legislation from the European Union and here are some requirements for farmers regarding biodiversity,” a spokesperson from the Danish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries told Check Your Fact in an email. “Denmark has no national legislation requiring people in Denmark to grow field flowers for the bees in 5% of the country.” Denmark in 2016 signed the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, pledging to increase the protection of biodiversity, as well as bees, butterflies and other insects, the Copenhagen Post reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsCharlese FreemanContributor","https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=10226362553080948&set=basw.AbohabaSBPs2oLJM0xMGlSme4XuUmhR0MLL0vOYvmJ5z0P5mIwVUO_HCst7-U0luc04DAlzHwQOvA7P5xCkcPr8JTWHe9uBlv-xYdhNywSB1HumcBl4UTc_hqi-GZqF1ZznWLL9uGR8SgkqJEE4HiDsH8rym667ZBB-DRSfHUYO1hQ&opaqueCursor=AbrNZjT-xznFAd475pyiYrwsTaoFTQpnjYhwl9CGd64R31X2pCzDNRWsOClNZoUY_XGKwuqc02I2skD4isYqfKWjjzrwkVHP_lZtAZxhW1yg_igmRikjzMfDuW6W9vVobgoeso65BPodfW6xgbdRKIaD9Fm3OxcGhpqWvHZXinIMxGpGnlLXiuYajwe8BITu7GT8kBqCFqCvwnk805icxClh_KUTmdm28aOUf2DTy7BGVX8WWNAmudLveUNE1oby0fcu3B8aADnTYcdHgejoEg8ISgVTf-GQWxIWV-NCDuGIsUV777KZaIfHFw-pT5eXW3YjMX1iGX1jf-tzluEA8aiMGkZS1tcbRz2Fh8vopCRJnN_TgNs0Qu7sEht9mobGgZ-9LCZq-5CcviKU37qPWNYjxU0-EkY70n5vF3hCMRwhIc3aG3wyPzXBbGS7Z7M4OCZgWKTxoz4tPOnOB1PfvnrqooO8mRVsxC1_BhPJVycDBGBtESco6f8fxDER3cvTv6BcNmmDv07Fp4Pi0HMMIrEG_9fBLHzRw72kXbNHnG-QDpQX848PX0-4QQP2JZLICb_MhpQbuQJ6O5QT4U59vtUDf9PO60bOCZFlQZrREjaFM4zcJrfyYltylPTYNj34wobeJlnIGAW7f4rT0t22RhZBArWdhsbTWCxPhoaena8K6M_CioMWEpSJcEkpjsbOn9Q,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250056,https://content.next.westlaw.com/0-522-0619?__lrTS=20210209034118550&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true,https://eng.lbst.dk/search/?L=0&id=1736&tx_solr%5Bq%5D=5%25+land+bee,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/06/30/fact-check-bee-hummingbird-smallest-bird-species/,https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/key-policies/common-agricultural-policy/income-support/greening_en#rules,https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/key-policies/common-agricultural-policy/income-support/greening_en#rules,https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/denmark_en,https://web.archive.org/web/20200626035259/https://cphpost.dk/?p=75495",Are Farmers In Denmark Required To Grow Field Flowers For Bees?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The video actually shows the floodwaters of a 2011 tsunami in Japan. Fact Check:   Record rainfall in the central Chinese province of Henan caused major flooding last week, with officials saying over 1 million people have been displaced, according to NPR. The flooding has killed at least 71 people, AFP reported. The footage in the July 24 Facebook post captures water carrying away cars, small aircraft and debris. Japanese text is displayed along with the watermark of a website run by Japan’s Jiji Press. The Facebook post’s caption alleges the scene depicts a “China Airport flooded.” In reality, the flooding in the video didn’t take place in China or any time this year. Jiji Press posted the same footage on YouTube in April 2011. The outlet said in the description that it originally came from the Japanese Coast Guard and showed the March 11 tsunami that year causing damage at an airfield near the Japanese city of Sendai. The Associated Press and EuroNews respectively posted footage of the same tsunami hitting Sendai Airport. The airport fully reopened in late September 2011, when planned international flights resumed, according to The Japan Times. (RELATED: Did Kevin McCarthy Say, ‘There Are No Mass Shootings In Japan Because There Are No Video Games There’?)  The March 2011 tsunami, which caused the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant meltdown, resulted from a magnitude nine earthquake off Japan’s coast, the Associated Press reported. The disaster killed over 15,000 people and left hundreds of thousands without homes, according to National Geographic.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/Street.News.head.office.2021/posts/3001550793415889,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Henan,+China/@33.7929366,109.0139006,6z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x35d692e354d4df61:0x82b2157827a21acb!8m2!3d34.2904302!4d113.3823545,https://www.npr.org/2021/07/25/1020342822/flooding-continues-to-devastate-zhengzhou-city-in-central-china,https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210727-death-toll-from-henan-floods-rises-to-71-as-china-braces-for-more-rain,https://www.facebook.com/Street.News.head.office.2021/posts/3001550793415889,https://www.jiji.com/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POtvED-A0Ms&t=1s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FvJ62qvLBY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzR2p9xQkSQ,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2011/09/26/national/sendai-airport-back-in-business/,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/10/07/fact-check-kevin-mccarthy-fox-news-mass-shootings-video-games-japan/,https://apnews.com/article/japan-accidents-tsunamis-earthquakes-42d4947609becd7f141e9524a8c98937,https://www.nationalgeographic.org/thisday/mar11/tohoku-earthquake-and-tsunami/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f2868097849d80b2919a9791998b9d878094939186dc919d9f",Does This Video Show Recent Flooding At A Chinese Airport?,,,,,,

It does not show a real species of jellyfish. Fact Check: The image shows an amorphous shape made of rings of red, green, yellow and orange that appears to be drifting through a body of water. “SPANISH DANCER JELLYFISH – Spanish dancing jellyfish found near the Tami Atoll in Papua New Guinea,” reads the image’s caption.   While there are, according to the Marine Biological Association, more than 200 different species of jellyfish, Check Your Fact didn’t find any species closely resembling the supposedly pictured “Spanish Dancer” in various jellyfish identification guides. There is a sea creature called the Spanish Dancer, but it is a sea slug rather than a jellyfish, according to National Geographic. “The image does not appear to show anatomical features of an authentic medusazoan (jellyfish),” Angel Yanagihara, an associate researcher at the Pacific Biosciences Research Center of the University of Hawaii, said in an email to Check Your Fact. (RELATED: Does This Image Show A Real ‘Hairy Frog’ Found In Cameroon?) A reverse image search revealed the image is actually a digital creation. The piece was first shared in August 2012 on the blog of French photographer and digital artist Francis Le Guen along with other images that, according to the blog, came “straight out of the Apophysis software.” It can also be found on the online art gallery Deviant Art, where Le Guen posted it with a caption that indicates it was created using “Apophysis7x.” Le Guen confirmed in an email to Check Your Fact that he created the piece of digital fractal artwork.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no evidence the military is “holding” the White House for Trump. The claim stems from a website that says it contains “humor, parody, and satire.” Fact Check:   The image shows what appears to be a screen grab of a July 23 article bearing the headline: “U.S. Military Holding White House for Trump’s Return.” The headline seemingly references the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory that suggests Trump will be reinstated as president at some point this year. (RELATED: No, This Photo Does Not Show A ‘Psyop’ White House Event Filmed In Atlanta) There is, however, no evidence that the military is “holding” the White House to prepare for Trump’s return. The White House is protected by the Secret Service, a non-military entity under the direction of the Department of Homeland Security, according to the Secret Service’s website. If the security of the White House had been passed to the military, major media outlets likely would have reported on it, yet none have. No announcement about such a development could be found on the Department of Defense’s (DoD) website or the Secret Service’s website either. Furthermore, President Joe Biden, the current president, is the commander in chief of the armed forces, as outlined in Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution. Check Your Fact previously debunked the false claim that the DoD does not recognize Biden as president. The screen grab in the Facebook post appears to come from an article published by Real Raw News. While Real Raw News includes a disclaimer in the “About Us” section of its website, saying it publishes “humor, parody, and satire,” social media users have shared the claim without such a warning, presenting the erroneous claim as authentic news.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

In reality, the scene depicted in the picture didn’t take place in London or during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Verdict: False The photo actually shows a 2019 religious celebration in Bangladesh. Fact Check:   Siddiqui, a Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist, was killed in Afghanistan on July 16 while covering the Afghan military’s attempt to oust the Taliban from the strategic Spin Boldak crossing on the border between southern Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to the Associated Press. His funeral was held on July 18 in New Delhi, India, according to The Indian Express. The Facebook post claims to show a photo from Siddiqui’s funeral in which thousands of people can be seen gathering around a decorated green-and-white truck as it drives down a street. “Danish siddique funeral….Ssshhhh secularism,” reads the post’s caption. (RELATED: Did The Taliban Shoot Down 2 US Aircraft And Kill 34 Soldiers In Afghanistan?) The picture, however, does not depict part of Siddiqui’s funeral. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found a photo shared on Flickr in November 2019 that closely resembles the one in the Facebook post. In the title of the Flickr album in which the similar photo appears, the scene is identified as a procession in Chattogram, Bangladesh, during the Islamic holiday Eid-e-Milad-ul-Nabi. The holiday, which marks the birthday of the Prophet Mohammad, was celebrated on Nov. 10 that year, according to the Dhaka Tribune. Footage of the 2019 celebration in Chattogram, Bangladesh, that was shared on YouTube confirms the Facebook image comes from the same event. Several landmarks in the photo match those visible in the videos.

Well I have seen tornadoes and rainbows occurring at the same time, a tornado will never actually wrap in the rainbow light, so to speak.” Real photos of rainbows near tornados have been included in reports by The Atlanta-Journal Constitution, San Francisco-based ABC 7 News and The Washington Post. None of the photos show a tornado that looks similar to the one in the Facebook post. “A person can take a photo where the rainbow passes in front of the tornado, but it cannot ‘suck’ color into the circulation,” Dr. William Gallus, professor of meteorology at Iowa State University said in an email to Check Your Fact.  Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found the picture published by the now-defunct Primal Urge Magazine, according to the journal’s former website. The artwork in the magazine includes a watermark reading: “Tornado Versus Rainbow,” and is described as “Digital Artwork by Corey Cowan (Photoshop manipulation).” The piece was also included in a February 2019 list published by The Weather Channel titled, “Fake and Overused Weather Photos: Avoid Sharing These Viral Images.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/groups/science.sci/posts/511603489909810/,https://www.ohio.edu/cas/houserj,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/07/30/fact-check-multiple-tornadoes-simultaneously-kansas/,https://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/tornado-rainbow-appear-side-by-side-during-massive-texas-storm/I47CRP4M2NEENIUD6GVQIMWPGQ/,https://abc7news.com/weather-tornado-rainbow-torando-video/718159/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/04/26/tornado-rainbow-texas/,https://ge-at.iastate.edu/directory/william-gallus/,http://www.primalurgemagazine.com/,http://www.primalurgemagazine.com/,https://weather.com/news/news/fake-overused-weather-photos-20140421,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5b2f293e2d34291b38333e383022342e293d3a382f75383436",Does This Image Show A Tornado Hitting A Rainbow?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The statement has been misattributed to Gates. A version of the quote has circulated online for several years. Fact Check:   Eid al-Adha, a major Islamic holiday, commemorates the prophet Abraham’s faith when God tested him with the command to sacrifice his son and can involve the slaughter of livestock, according to USA Today. The holiday was celebrated in July this year, the Associated Press reported. (RELATED: Is Bill Gates The Grandson Of Rockefeller Foundation Co-Founder Frederick Taylor Gates?) The image in the July 20 Facebook post quotes Gates as saying, “I do not want to see a hate of Muslims because of their sacrifice during Eidhuladha. There are millions of animals killed daily in the restaurants of KFC, McDonald’s and Burger King. This is in order to feed the rich and earn a lot of money. While Muslims on Eid sacrifice these animals to feed the poor & give them free of charge. Have we lost our minds?” There is, however, no record of Gates making the statement. A search of his verified Twitter and Facebook accounts didn’t turn up any matches for the supposed quote. Nor does the comment about animal sacrifice during Eid al-Adha appear in posts on his personal blog. Check Your Fact didn’t find any media outlets attributing the comment to Gates. A similar statement appeared in an August 2019 tweet from the Twitter account @WolfieBabiee. The tweet, which did not attribute the words to Gates or any other public figure, has garnered over 42,000 retweets and 83,000 likes as of press time.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/mehraj.din.9237/posts/2956739227928297,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/07/19/when-eid-al-adha-2021-how-muslim-festival-celebrated/8011766002/,https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-africa-health-travel-religion-cb795523164369918820c130a10e8279,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/07/21/fact-check-bill-gates-grandson-co-founder-rockefeller-foundation-frederick-taylor-gates/,https://www.facebook.com/mehraj.din.9237/posts/2956739227928297,https://twitter.com/search?q=Eid%20(from%3ABillGates)&src=typed_query,https://www.facebook.com/page/216311481960/search/?q=Eid,https://www.gatesnotes.com/Search?search=Eid,https://www.google.com/search?q=Bill+Gates+%22There+are+millions+of+animals+killed+daily+in+the+restaurants+of+KFC%2C+McDonald%27s+and+Burger+King%22&oq=Bill+Gates+%22There+are+millions+of+animals+killed+daily+in+the+restaurants+of+KFC%2C+McDonald%27s+and+Burger+King%22&aqs=chrome..69i57j0j0i433l8.6165j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://twitter.com/WolfieBabiee/status/1160255480209596416,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c4b0b6a1b2abb684a7aca1a7afbdabb1b6a2a5a7b0eaa7aba9",Did Bill Gates Make This Statement About Eid al-Adha Animal Sacrifices?,,,,,,

Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has been arrested for treason.  Verdict: False There is no evidence Milley has been arrested for treason. The claim may stem from a website that says it publishes “humor, parody, and satire.” Fact Check:   Milley has served as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff since October 2019, according to the Department of Defense website. He made headlines earlier this month after excerpts from the recently released book “I Alone Can Fix It: Donald J. Trump’s Catastrophic Final Year” said Milley was reportedly concerned former President Donald Trump may attempt a coup in the wake of the 2020 presidential election, according to CNN. A viral July 22 Facebook post baselessly alleges Milley was “forced to retire then arrested,” saying in part, “Milley found himself on the wrong side of politics. He was egotistical and angry with Trump. He was arrested for treason and taken to GITMO.”(RELATED: Has Susan Rice Been Convicted Of Treason?) Yet, contrary to the post’s claim, the Joint Chiefs of Staff website still lists Milley as the chairman. Had he been “forced to retire” and subsequently “arrested for treason,” major news outlets would have reported it. The Joint Chiefs of Staff has also not mentioned anything to that effect in its media releases, nor has the Department of Justice or Department of Defense announced such a thing. Milley participated in a news briefing at the Pentagon alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on July 21, a video shared on YouTube by PBS NewsHour shows. According to the Joint Chiefs of Staff website, he also had a meeting with Croatian Chief of Defense Adm. Robert Hranj on July 23, a day after the Facebook post made the claim.  The post’s claim may have originated from a May 5 Real Raw News article, titled “Pentagon Coup! Joint Chiefs Overthrown,” that alleges Milley was arrested in mid-April for being a “traitor to America and its people” and taken to Guantanamo Bay. Real Raw News, however, includes a disclaimer on its “About Us” page that states the website “contains humor, parody, and satire.” The Joint Chiefs of Staff did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The course has been in use since at least 2014, years before the COVID-19 pandemic. Fact Check:  The image in the Instagram post shows what appears to be a screenshot of an article bearing the headline, “DHS TRAINING COURSE: PREPARE FOR MASS PUBLIC QUARANTINE OF UNVACCINATED RURAL AMERICANS.” The article goes on to mention a training course, titled “Isolation & Quarantine For Rural Communities,” offered by the Rural Domestic Preparedness Consortium (RDPC)   There is, however, no evidence that there will be a “mass public quarantine of unvaccinated rural Americans.” The training course in question is meant for “situations requiring the isolation and quarantine (I&Q) of a large portion of a local, rural population,” according to the RDPC. The RDPC is a training provider for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and its curriculum is DHS certified, according to its website. Check Your Fact reviewed the training course overview and materials and did not find any mention of vaccinated or unvaccinated people. The course overview’s five modules deal with issues such as the legal justification for quarantining and isolation, effective public communication techniques and emergency response activities, among other things, but did not mention quarantining unvaccinated individuals. Michael Crowhurst of the RDPC told Check Your Fact in an email that the course has been in use since March 2014, and the current version is from August 2019. For example, the RDPC tweeted about the course being held in Bowling Green, Kentucky in October 2014. Crowhurst further said the training course does not discuss quarantining unvaccinated individuals. Nor was the course created in response to COVID-19. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims ICE Agents Will Be At All Polling Stations On Election Day)  “Instructors do describe the impact of COVID-19 on best practices and recommended procedures for local responders, described in the participant guide to ensure participants have current actionable information when they leave the class,” Crowhurst added. The article originates from shtfplan.com, a website that describes itself as “here to help you figure out WTF is going on in today’s world.” The website also includes a disclaimer, stating that “ideas expressed on this site are solely the opinions of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent the opinions of sponsors or firms affiliated with the author(s).”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Her publicist said she and her children are “fully vaccinated” against COVID-19. Fact Check:   The meme features a picture of “The Big Bang Theory” actress Bialik, who received a doctorate in neuroscience from UCLA. It alleges she “refuses to vaccinate” and contains the hashtag “SmartParentsDon’tVax.” (RELATED: Image Claims To Show A CDC Infographic Saying ‘Refusing To Take The Vaccine Is A Form Of Racism’) Bialik, who has faced criticism for prior comments she has made about vaccines, has said she and her children are vaccinated, however. In an October 2020 YouTube video, Bialik stated that she would be getting both the COVID-19 and flu vaccine this year and that her two children would also be getting flu vaccines. “This year I’m going to do something I literally haven’t done in 30 years. I’m going to get a vaccine. And guess what? I’m actually going to get two,” Bialik said in the video. “Number one vaccine that I’m going to get is the COVID vaccine. I can’t wait for it, bring it on. Number two vaccine, I’m going to get a flu vaccine.” She also stated in the video, “My 12- and 15-year old children have never received a flu vaccine. This year, roll up them shirt sleeves, boys, vaccines for everyone.” At one point in the video, she says that she believes the perception that she is anti-vaccination stems from a book she wrote about her experience parenting, noting, “At the time my children had not received the typical schedule of vaccines, but I have never, not once, said that vaccines are not valuable, not useful or not necessary, because they are.”  “As of today, my children may not have had every one of the vaccinations that your children have, but my children are vaccinated. I repeat: my children are vaccinated,” she said in the October 2020 YouTube video. In a February 2015 tweet, she also said her kids are vaccinated. Bialik expressed support for COVID-19 vaccines in a January 2021 interview with Yahoo! Life and in a May 2021 interview with Cheddar News. In both interviews, she said her children were vaccinated and, in the Cheddar News interview, confirmed she received the COVID-19 vaccine. “It’s not ‘I’m pro every single vaccine that anyone talks about all the time everywhere, every single minute,'” she said, according to Yahoo! Life. “I have a lot of questions about the vaccine industry, as do a lot of people. I have a lot of questions about the profits involved. [But] when it comes to this virus, the insidiousness of this virus, the way this virus works, the way that it adapts, we absolutely need to see this as distinctly different from the flu.

Verdict: False The footage actually shows French police showing support for health care workers protesting in June 2020. Fact Check:   Protests broke out in multiple French cities after French President Emmanuel Macron announced new COVID-19-related rules on July 12, Reuters reported. The rules include mandating health care workers be vaccinated by September 15, and requiring health passes showing proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test in order to enter venues such as restaurants, bars and theaters, as well as board trains and planes, according to the outlet. A video shared on Facebook on July 17 purportedly shows a scene from the recent protests in which law enforcement personnel placed their helmets on the ground as civilians gathered around them and applauded. “Police in France with the people of France take off their helmets,” the video’s caption reads. “This happened during this weeks protests ! Let’s goooo France.” (RELATED: Does This Image Show An ‘Electric Car Cemetery’ In France?) The video, however, predates the recent demonstrations against COVID-19 restrictions in France. Through a reverse image search of key frames, Check Your Fact found similar footage published on YouTube by French magazine L’Obs in June 2020, with the title: “Police officers and caregivers applaud during the demonstration in Nîmes.”  The video showed police in Nimes, France, on June 16, 2020, acknowledging health care workers who were protesting in support of a public hospital there, according to a translation of the video’s description. Tens of thousands of French medical workers demonstrated on June 16, 2020, advocating for the country’s government to raise health service wages, pause service cuts and stop hospitals from closing amid the pandemic, France 24 reported. The government signed an agreement with unions on July 13, 2020 enacting roughly $9 billion in wage increases for health care personnel, according to BBC News.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/cynara.issa/posts/10159363056387180,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/french-police-quell-protest-against-covid-health-passport-rules-2021-07-14/,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-make-covid-19-shot-mandatory-health-workers-bfm-tv-2021-07-12/,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/07/14/fact-check-image-electric-car-cemetery-france/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLlvS7Fnyb0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLlvS7Fnyb0,https://www.france24.com/en/20200616-enough-applause-french-health-workers-rally-anew-for-post-coronavirus-reforms,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53398208,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4e3a3c2b38213c0e2d262b2d2537213b3c282f2d3a602d2123",Does This Video Show French Police Setting Down Their Helmets In Support Of Protesters In July 2021?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The Canadian government allows pilots who have received Health Canada-approved COVID-19 vaccines to fly. Fact Check:   The image shows the headline of a July 11 post from the website Alt News that reads, “Canada Prohibits All Vaxxed Pilots From Flying. The Corona Vax Is A ‘Medical Trial’ And Such ‘Vaccinations’ Are Ruled To Ground All Pilots.” (RELATED: Viral Post Claims Fox News Isn’t Available In Canada) Below the headline, there is a screen grab of the Canadian government’s website from the Transport Canada section titled “COVID-19 vaccines and Aviation Medical Certificate holders.” A highlighted line in the screen grab states that “participation in medical trials is not considered compatible with aviation medical certification.” While the post attempts to allege that all Canadian pilots who received COVID-19 vaccines are prohibited from flying because the vaccines are supposedly considered a “medical trial,” that is not the case. The Canadian government’s website explicitly states that COVID-19 vaccines approved by Health Canada “are considered compatible with Transport Canada aviation Medical Certification.” That means pilots who received them are allowed to fly. Health Canada has approved the COVID-19 vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca. The Canadian government’s website states, “Only vaccines that are proven to be safe, effective and of high quality are authorized for use in Canada. The COVID-19 vaccines have been rigorously tested during their development and then carefully reviewed by Health Canada.”  Sau Sau Liu, a spokesperson for Transport Canada, confirmed in an email to Check Your Fact that the post’s claim is inaccurate, saying, “Transport Canada does not prohibit pilots vaccinated with Health Canada-approved vaccines to fly nor do we impose grounding periods for aviators who wish to take vaccines approved by Health Canada.” The Transport Canada section of the Canadian government’s website also states, “Transport Canada (TC) Civil Aviation Medicine (CAM), does not impose grounding periods for aviators who wish to take vaccines approved by Health Canada.” “All COVID-19 vaccines currently available in Canada have gone through clinical trials and been tested on tens of thousands of adult volunteers before being authorized for use,” Liu also said. “They were deemed to be safe and effective and have been licensed and authorized by Health Canada. They are not medical trials.” The notice about it being the “general position of TC CAM that participation in medical trials is not considered compatible with aviation medical certification” on the webpage was included earlier in the pandemic “when aviators started asking if they could take part in the vaccine trials that Health Canada was undertaking prior to the approval of the vaccines for general distribution,” according to Liu.  if(dc_showing_ads) { var scr = document.createElement('script'); scr.async= true; scr.src = ""https://get.civicscience.com/jspoll/5/csw-polyfills.js""; document.getElementsByTagName(""body"")[0].appendChild(scr); } Liu told Check Your Fact that because Health Canada has approved the COVID-19 vaccines for use and the notice about medical trials “is less relevant,” Transport Canada has since removed it from the webpage.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no record of Macron making this statement. Fact Check: The French government recently announced that it would mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for all health care workers, according to Reuters. The government also set forth requirements that people would need passes documenting they have been vaccinated against COVID-19, recently tested negative for the virus or recovered from the illness in order to enter venues such as restaurants, bars and theaters, the outlet reported.   Now, an image on Facebook shows what appears to be a screen grab of a tweet seemingly quoting the French president. “I no longer have any intention of sacrificing my life, my time, my freedom and the adolescence of my daughters, as well as their right to study properly, for those who refuse to be vaccinated,” Macron purportedly said. “This time you stay at home, not us.” There is, however, no record of Macron saying the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. Check Your Fact reviewed a speech Macron gave on July 12, but found no mention of him saying people who refuse to be vaccinated should stay home. The supposed quote was not found on the Élysée Palace website either. A search of Macron’s verified social media accounts likewise turned up no instances of the alleged quote. Furthermore, the French president has three adult stepchildren and no biological children of his own, The Sun reported in 2020. (RELATED: Does This Image Show A 2021 Protest Against France’s COVID-19 Measures?) The misattribution may stem from confusion surrounding an Instagram post from Italian journalist Selvaggia Lucarelli. Lucarelli posted a picture of Macron and included a similar quote to the one erroneously attributed to Macron as the caption. The quote is not attributed to Macron in the post.  “I’m for the French line right now. I no longer have any intention whatsoever of sacrificing my life, my time, and my son’s adolescence, in addition to his right to study properly, for those who refuse to get vaccinated,” a translation of Lucarelli’s Instagram caption reads. “This time you stay home, not us.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no evidence that Castro has fled Cuba. The image featured in the post was taken in 2015 and shows Castro landing in Costa Rica to attend a summit. Fact Check:   Thousands of Cubans angered by food and medicine shortages participated in anti-government protests on July 11, with many calling for freedom and for Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel to resign, CNN reported. Now, an image on Facebook shows Castro exiting a plane and claims he fled to Venezuela during the protests. “BREAKING – Cuba: Former President Raúl Castro flees to Venezuela,” reads the image’s caption. “He arrived in Caracas around 11:37 pm, Sunday, July 11, 2021 as massive anti-government protests erupted in the socialist regime.” There is no evidence, however, that Castro fled to Venezuela on July 11. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found the photo in a January 2015 article published by La Nación, explaining it shows him arriving in Costa Rica to attend that year’s Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) summit. “Raúl Castro arrived at the Juan Santamaría airport to attend the Celac Summit that starts tomorrow in the country,” reads a translation of the image’s caption on La Nación. “He is the first president to arrive on Costa Rican soil and was received by Vice President Ana Helena Chacón.”  The photo was also included in articles published by Cuba Debate and teleSUR. Both outlets also reported the image showed Castro arriving in Costa Rica for the CELAC summit. (RELATED: Does This Video Show A Recent Anti-Government Protest In Cuba?) Had Castro actually fled Cuba during the July 11 protests, media outlets likely would have reported on it, yet none have.”Raúl Castro is very well and in Cuba,” said Noraimis Ramos Ruiz, a spokesperson for the Cuban government, in an email to Check Your Fact. Castro appeared at a pro-government rally in Havana, Cuba on July 17, according to the Associated Press.  if(dc_showing_ads) { var scr = document.createElement('script'); scr.async= true; scr.src = ""https://get.civicscience.com/jspoll/5/csw-polyfills.js""; document.getElementsByTagName(""body"")[0].appendChild(scr); }  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no evidence Rice has been convicted of treason or sentenced to death. The claim stems from a website that says it publishes “humor, parody, and satire.” Fact Check:   The lengthy post claims the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps on July 8 convicted Rice of “high treason” for “her participation in a 2017 scheme to defame” former President Donald Trump in connection to alleged “Russian collusion.” Rice, who served as former President Barack Obama’s national security adviser from 2013 to 2017, faced scrutiny for her role in “unmasking” some Trump transition officials in intelligence reports on communications with foreigners under surveillance, according to CNBC. In the post, it also alleges Navy Vice Admiral John Hannink was involved in her trial. At the end of the trial, a “three-officer panel unanimously agreed Rice be put to death for her crimes against America,” the post claims. There is, however, no evidence Rice was convicted of treason or sentenced to death. A search of press releases put out by the Department of Justice and the Department of Defense didn’t turn up any announcements to that effect. National media outlets haven’t reported on Rice getting convicted of treason. She has also been active on Twitter since July 8, the date she was supposedly sentenced to death, further adding to the post’s dubiousness. “No truth to this claim,” a Department of Defense spokesperson said in an email to Check Your Fact. (RELATED: No, Donald Rumsfeld Did Not Commit Suicide At A Military Tribunal)  The text in the Facebook post matches that in a July 20 article published by Real Raw News, a website that states on its “About Us” page that it “contains humor, parody, and satire.” While Real Raw News includes that disclaimer, the Facebook post does not, resulting in some users seemingly believing the story is real.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no evidence Trump released the statement. The fabricated press release appears to originate from a Twitter user as a joke. Fact Check:   The Tampa Bay Buccaneers won Super Bowl LV in February, marking Brady’s seventh Super Bowl win, according to CBS Sports. Brady and his teammates on July 20 visited the White House, where the quarterback cracked a joke about people not believing the Buccaneers won the Super Bowl, footage from The Hill shows. “Not a lot of people think that we could have won and, in fact, I think about 40 percent of people still don’t think we won,” Brady said, referencing people who deny President Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election. Shortly after Brady made the joke, social media users started sharing a screen grab of what looks like a statement from Trump. In the alleged press release, the former president appears to respond to Brady’s joke, calling the quarterback “shady.” “Tom ‘Shady’ needs to do his research and realize how Rigged (and Rigged it was) the last election was,” the purported Trump statement reads. “Maybe he was too busy Deflating balls (weak grip?) to follow what is happening all around our Great Country (including Maricopa County, Georgia and Pennsylvania). When I’m back in the White House we’ll see who he jokes with (the answer is Me, your favorite ‘President’, if I even invite him). So much Voter Fraud!”  There is, however, no record of Trump putting out the statement pictured in the Facebook post. A search of Trump’s website, as well as his 45office.com website, didn’t turn up any statements calling Brady “shady.” (RELATED: Did Tom Brady Say, ‘If Anybody On This Team Kneels, I Walk’?) Brady’s joke at the White House was widely covered by national news outlets. If Trump had put out the statement in response, it would have been picked up by the media, yet no major news outlets have reported on it. Multiple Twitter users also shared the fake statement on Twitter. The fabricated press release appears to have been originally posted by the Twitter user @skolanach, whose handle is visible in the upper-left corner. The Twitter user later clarified it was a joke.  if(dc_showing_ads) { var scr = document.createElement('script'); scr.async= true; scr.src = ""https://get.civicscience.com/jspoll/5/csw-polyfills.js""; document.getElementsByTagName(""body"")[0].appendChild(scr); }  I made it.

Verdict: False Rumsfeld’s cause of death was multiple myeloma. The claim appears to stem from a website that says it publishes “humor, parody, and satire.” Fact Check:   Rumsfeld, the Defense secretary to former Presidents Gerald Ford and George W. Bush, died on June 29 at 88 years old, according to CNBC. Now, some social media users are sharing a post claiming Rumsfeld actually died by suicide during a military tribunal. Rumsfeld did not, however, commit suicide, and was never on trial before a military tribunal. No mention of such a trial or any charges against him can be found in press releases published by the Justice Department or the Defense Department. Current Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin tweeted on June 30 that he was “saddened to hear” about Rumsfeld’s death, stating, “I extend my deep condolences to his family and loved ones.” Had Rumsfeld committed suicide at a military tribunal, media outlets certainly would have reported on it, yet none have done so. Keith Urbahn, Rumsfeld’s spokesperson, said multiple myeloma caused his death, USA Today reported. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show Article About Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin Considering ‘Defunding, Maybe Disbanding’ The US Army) The claim appears to stem from a July 18 article published by Real Raw News bearing the headline: “Rumsfeld Committed Suicide at Military Tribunal; Did Not Die of Natural Causes.” The article goes on to claim Rumsfeld was arrested on May 27, and that he killed himself after the military tribunal found him responsible for the deaths of American soldiers during the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars.  Real Raw News includes a disclaimer on it’s “About Us” page that states, “This website contains humor, parody, and satire.” Despite the disclaimer, social media users have shared the claim without such a warning, seemingly believing it to be true. This is not the first time a claim stemming from a Real Raw News article has been shared as misinformation.

Maybe it’s time to issue an executive order requiring all Popeyes in Florida to re-stock them ASAP??”  A schedule available on the Florida governor’s website shows DeSantis visited the Miami office of Restaurant Brands International, the parent company of Popeyes, on Sept. 27, 2019. The News Service of Florida also reported on his visit at the time. The novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 first emerged in late 2019, according to The New York Times. DeSantis did not, according to the Washington Post, issue a statewide mask mandate last year, though he did institute a lockdown in April 2020. In May, he signed an executive order suspending local COVID-19 rules for individuals and businesses, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Friends of Ron DeSantis, the governor’s political committee, recently started selling merchandise such as “Don’t Fauci My Florida” t-shirts and “How the hell am I going to be able to drink a beer with a mask on?” beer koozies, according to the Tallahassee Democrat. None of the merchandise for sale matches the t-shirt in the photoshopped image.  if(dc_showing_ads) { var scr = document.createElement('script'); scr.async= true; scr.src = ""https://get.civicscience.com/jspoll/5/csw-polyfills.js""; document.getElementsByTagName(""body"")[0].appendChild(scr); } The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends for individuals ages 2 and older who are not fully vaccinated to wear masks in public indoor spaces to help protect against COVID-19. Fully vaccinated individuals “can resume activities without wearing a mask or physically distancing, except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance,” according to the CDC website.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsRyan KingContributor","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158662044432756&set=a.10152960751952756&type=3,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158662044432756&set=a.10152960751952756&type=3,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/07/06/fact-check-ron-desantis-press-conference-surfside-condo-collapse/,https://twitter.com/GovRonDeSantis/status/1177677167251148801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/popeyeschicken?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/BurgerKing?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://t.co/SagYhmAxcj,https://twitter.com/GovRonDeSantis/status/1177677167251148801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/GovRonDeSantis/status/1177677167251148801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/9.27.19.png,https://www.mypanhandle.com/news/gov-ron-desantis-wants-to-taste-test-popeyes-and-chick-fil-a-chicken-sandwiches/,https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-timeline.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/07/13/desantis-fauci-florida/,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/01/825383186/florida-governor-orders-statewide-lockdown,https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2021/05/04/what-we-know-about-desantis-executive-order-suspending-local-covid-19-restrictions/,https://twitter.com/teamrondesantis/status/1414676440533159937,https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2021/07/15/ron-desantis-releases-merchandise-against-masks-and-anthony-fauci-florida-coronavirus/7976313002/,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html",Did Ron DeSantis Pose For A Photo Holding Up This Anti-Mask Shirt?,,,,,,

Rockefeller’s advisor Frederick Taylor Gates.  Verdict: False Bill Gates is not Frederick Taylor Gates’ grandson. Fact Check:   The image shows what appears to be a screen grab of Frederick Taylor Gates’ Wikipedia entry displayed on Google. Green text added to the screen grab claims he is Bill Gates’ grandfather. Frederick Taylor Gates managed Rockefeller’s charitable activities and was instrumental in the founding of the philanthropic Rockefeller Foundation, serving on its board of trustees until 1923, according to The Rockefeller Archive Center. (RELATED: Have Bill Gates, Anthony Fauci, The WHO And Others Been Charged With War Crimes?) Despite sharing a surname with Frederick Taylor Gates, Bill Gates is not his grandson. Bill Gates’ father and mother were Bill Gates Sr. and Mary Maxwell, who died in 2020 and 1994 respectively, according to NBC News. Bill Gates Sr., also known as William H. Gates II, was born in 1925 to furniture store owners in Washington state, ABC News reported. Frederick Taylor Gates died in 1929, while his wife Emma Cahoon Gates lived until 1934, The New York Times reported. They had seven children, according to his autobiography “Chapters in My Life,” none of whom were named William or Mary.  An internet search by Check Your Fact found no credible media report of Frederick Taylor Gates being Bill Gates’ grandfather. Bill Gates hasn’t mentioned Frederick Taylor Gates in any entry of his personal blog either. The Rockefeller Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation collaborated in 2006 to create the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), an initiative to lessen poverty in the continent through agricultural investment, according to The Rockefeller Foundation’s website.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/miguel.cuervo.5249/posts/188296246565526,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Frederick-T-Gates,https://rockfound.rockarch.org/biographical/-/asset_publisher/6ygcKECNI1nb/content/frederick-t-gates?,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/05/13/fact-check-image-bill-gates-anthony-fauci-violating-social-distancing-guidelines-coronavirus/,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bill-gates-sr-father-microsoft-co-founder-dies-94-n1240189,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/bill-gates-sr-father-microsoft-founder-dies-94-73033685,https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1929/02/07/95877097.pdf?pdf_redirect=true&ip=0,https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1934/04/07/93757961.pdf,https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/35101532/frederick-taylor-gates,https://www.google.com/books/edition/Chapters_in_My_Life/1Yu5AAAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0,https://www.google.com/search?q=frederick+taylor+gates+Bill+Gates+grandfather&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjr2MuDw_TxAhXAFFkFHYujBjoQ_AUoAHoECAcQAg&biw=1440&bih=717&dpr=2,https://www.gatesnotes.com/Search?search=%22Frederick%20Taylor%20Gates%22,https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/initiative/alliance-for-a-green-revolution-in-africa/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c9bdbbacbfa6bb89aaa1acaaa2b0a6bcbbafa8aabde7aaa6a4",Is Bill Gates The Grandson Of Rockefeller Foundation Co-Founder Frederick Taylor Gates?,,,,,,

Verdict: False Biden has been photoshopped into the photo. Fact Check:   The “Drivers License” singer visited the White House last week as part of the Biden administration’s effort to encourage more young people to get COVID-19 vaccinations, according to the Associated Press. Following her White House visit, some social media users started sharing an altered image appearing to show Biden touching her shoulders. In the original picture taken by photographer Oliver Contreras for Bloomberg in the White House briefing room, only Rodrigo and White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki can be seen. Biden did not attend the July 14 briefing in which Rodrigo participated, a review of the transcript and footage from the briefing shows. (RELATED: Viral Image Makes False Claim About Joe And Jill Biden’s Relationship) Biden has been digitally edited into the photo of Rodrigo and Psaki in the briefing room. The picture of Biden comes from the 2015 swearing-in ceremony for former Defense Secretary Ash Carter, when the then-vice president put his hands on the shoulders of Ash Carter’s wife Stephanie and spoke to her. Some people pointed to the picture of Biden and Stephanie Carter during the 2020 presidential election cycle to criticize him for his interactions with women. Stephanie Carter said in a 2019 Medium post that the picture had been “misleadingly” taken out-of-context and that Biden touched her shoulders “as a means of offering his support.”  Rodrigo and Biden did share actual photos of them together during her White House visit to their respective Instagram accounts.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMecca FowlerContributor","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=4418281911550182&set=a.600404043338007&type=3&theater,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmDBbnmKpqQ,https://apnews.com/article/olivia-rodrigo-visits-white-house-vaccines-07aeaeb169aa7daed999dd48d57e06a0,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=4418281911550182&set=a.600404043338007&type=3&theater,https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/jen-psaki-white-house-press-secretary-right-introduces-pop-news-photo/1233977853?adppopup=true,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/07/14/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-july-14-2021/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek6Y3jzOLP4,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/01/28/fact-check-joe-jill-biden-babysitter-wife-hospitalized/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3gGncZMCKQ,https://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/Obama-Defense-Secretary-/d6517cafb1ce43a18fd9fb9abd5202e9/2/0,https://www.vox.com/2019/4/2/18290345/joe-biden-lucy-flores-amy-lappos,https://medium.com/@scarterdc/the-metoo-story-that-wasnt-me-6c1d5eb1e94d,https://www.instagram.com/p/CRU-J7yr2jT/?utm_medium=copy_link,https://www.instagram.com/p/CRU9pq4rEKj/",Does This Image Show Joe Biden Touching Olivia Rodrigo’s Shoulders?,,,,,,

The claim appears to stem from a satirical article. Fact Check:   The Facebook photo shows what appears to be a screen grab of a June 21 article including an image of Biden and bearing the headline: “Announces Americans Not Vaccinated Before 2022 Will Be Put In Camps.” Text in the screen grab goes on to say that unvaccinated Americans will be detained in “quarantine camps” until they are vaccinated. There is no record, however, of Biden making such an announcement. A search of the White House’s website turned up no mention of imprisoning unvaccinated Americans. Check Your Fact also searched Biden’s verified social media accounts, but found no instances of him announcing such a plan. While the Biden administration has been actively working to get more Americans vaccinated against COVID-19, according to The New York Times, Check Your Fact found no news reporting about the president announcing any plan to imprison those who refuse to be vaccinated. (RELATED: Did Joe Biden Announce Looting Would Be Renamed ‘Justice Shopping’?) The screen grabbed article in the Facebook post appears to have been published by Value Walk, a website that “provides unique coverage on hedge funds, large asset managers, and value investing,” according to its “About” section. A clear disclaimer at the bottom of the article says, “This is a satirical article.”  Value Walk also included a notice that the article was first posted by The Stonk Market, a financial satire website. While both Value Walk and The Stonk Market include disclaimers about the satirical nature of the story, social media users have been sharing the claim without such a warning, seemingly believing the erroneous claim to be true.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

There were also no major solar storms last week. Fact Check:   Solar storms are natural phenomena that occur when disturbances on the sun, such as solar flares or coronal mass ejections, emit electromagnetic radiation and charged particle radiation into the solar system, according to CBS News. Under certain conditions, such solar activity can disrupt satellites as well as technologies on Earth like GPS and radio communications, according to NASA. The July 14 Instagram post claims a “massive solar storm” that can impact GPS, internet and satellites is heading toward Earth. However, there is no mention of an imminent solar storm to that effect on the Space Weather Prediction Center’s three-day forecast, and no such storm occurred last week. The forecast on Monday said, “Solar activity is likely to remain very low with a slight chance for C-class flares on 19-21 Jul,” while Tuesday’s forecast currently states, “Solar activity is expected to be very low, with an increasing chance of C-class flares 20-22 Jul.” C-class solar flares are “too weak to noticeably affect Earth,” according to NASA. “The solar observations have been greatly mischaracterized,” Theo Stein, a spokesperson for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), said in an email to Check Your Fact. (RELATED: No, This Is Not A ‘Photo From Mars’ Fabricated By NASA)  The last significant solar activity registered by the NOAA occurred on July 3, when an X-1 solar flare was observed. X-class flares are the strongest type of solar flare and can affect Earth, according to NASA. The July 3 flare was the largest since 2017 and caused a brief radio blackout, according to Space.com.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False While Make-A-Wish is requiring families to be vaccinated for wishes involving air travel and large crowds, it is not denying wishes to unvaccinated children. The claim appears to stem from a misunderstanding of a video from the Make-A-Wish CEO. Fact Check:   The Make-A-Wish Foundation is a non-profit organization that grants wishes to critically ill children, according to the foundation’s website. Now, a post on Facebook claims the organization decided to only grant wishes to children who are fully vaccinated. The coronavirus pandemic put thousands of wishes on hold due to stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions and event cancellations, NBC South Florida reported in May 2020. Other children had to alter their wishes, according to USA Today. There is no evidence, however, that Make-A-Wish is refusing to grant wishes to unvaccinated children. An internet search conducted by Check Your Fact found no media outlets reporting that the foundation is mandating vaccines before children can receive wishes, only other fact-checking outlets debunking the claim. The claim appears to stem from a deceptively edited video shared on Twitter, that showed Make-A-Wish CEO Richard Davis speaking about updates to Make-A-Wish’s COVID-19 policies. In the edited video, Davis says wishes involving air travel within the U.S. and large gatherings will resume September 15, but will require all participants, including the child making a wish, to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.  The Twitter video, which was originally sent in an email to Make-A-Wish families, was edited to end before Davis finished explaining which children would be eligible for wishes involving air travel and large gatherings, the Associated Press reported. (RELATED: Does The Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine Contain Graphene Oxide?) The foundation on June 28 published a statement on its website clarifying the misinformation surrounding its vaccine policy. “Make-A-Wish has not, does not and will not deny wishes to children who are not vaccinated,” the statement reads, in part. “Since the beginning of the pandemic, Make-A-Wish has safely granted over 6,500 wishes to children and families – regardless of vaccination status. Make-A-Wish will continue to grant wishes to children who are not vaccinated.” The statement goes on to explain that there are other types of wishes to choose from that don’t require being vaccinated, such as road trips, shopping sprees, meeting a celebrity and room decorations. The vaccine policy does not apply to children who have received a terminal prognosis, according to the statement.  if(dc_showing_ads) { var scr = document.createElement('script'); scr.async= true; scr.src = ""https://get.civicscience.com/jspoll/5/csw-polyfills.js""; document.getElementsByTagName(""body"")[0].appendChild(scr); }  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMecca FowlerContributor","https://www.facebook.com/MarchAgainstCorruption/posts/2326354117495293,https://wish.org/about-us,https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/coronavirus/make-a-wish-trying-to-make-dreams-come-true-during-pandemic/2227685/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/lifestyle/2020/08/19/make-a-wish-still-helping-dreams-come-true-during-pandemic-mdash-just-different-ones/113347928/,https://www.google.com/search?q=Make-A-wish+refusing+to+grant+wishes+unvaccinated+children&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS890US890&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjjmpTgo_LxAhVrElkFHSLbCVsQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1440&bih=717,https://twitter.com/Pelham_3/status/1407964106653536256,https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-business-6ecfe4db4e9eef5d0577a11aaba0f985,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/07/12/fact-check-pfizer-covid-vaccine-graphene-oxide/,https://wish.org/news-releases/vaccine-policy,https://wish.org/news-releases/vaccine-policy",Is The Make-A-Wish Foundation Only Granting Wishes To Fully Vaccinated Children?,,,,,,

Fact Check:   The image of a woman holding a French flag while a massive crowd gathers below on the Champs-Elysees avenue in Paris has circulated on Instagram and Facebook recently. In numerous instances, users alleged in the captions that it depicts a protest against the French government’s new COVID-19 mitigation measures. The French government recently announced measures that will mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for all health care workers and that will require people get special health passes documenting they have been vaccinated against COVID-19, recently tested negative for the virus or recovered from it to enter venues such as restaurants, bars and theaters, according to Reuters. The announcement of those measures resulted in over 100,000 people protesting across France this past weekend, the Associated Press reported. A reverse image search revealed the photo actually dates back to 2018 and shows people in Paris celebrating the French national soccer team winning the FIFA World Cup. France won the World Cup that year after beating Croatia 4-2 in the final match, NPR reported. AFP photographer Ludovic Marin took the picture. (RELATED: Image Claims To Show Cuban Farmer Before Being Executed For Refusing To Work For The Castro Regime) “This picture taken from the top of the Arch of Triumph (Arc de Triomphe) on July 15, 2018 shows people celebrating France’s victory in the Russia 2018 World Cup final football match between France and Croatia, on the Champs-Elysees avenue in Paris,” reads the caption on Getty Images.

Verdict: False The image, which was taken in 2019, actually shows a farmers’ protest in the Netherlands, not New Zealand. Fact Check:   In recent days, New Zealand farmers have been participating in a demonstration called “Howl Of A Protest,” and have been driving their tractors into cities, causing traffic jams, Reuters reported. The farmers are protesting the New Zealand government’s environmental and climate change policies, among other regulations, that some believe are hurting their business, according to the outlet. Now some social media users have been sharing an image, supposedly from the protests, showing dozens of tractors driving down one side of a highway. “Farmer’s protest today! pukekohe to Auckland,” the image’s caption reads. “Standing up to our tyrannical government that are land grabbing and destroying farmer’s lively hoods. We need to support them for the farmers feed us!” The image does not, however, show the recent New Zealand protests. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found a near-identical photo on Shutterstock. The image shared on Facebook appears to have flipped and cropped the original photo. The photo was actually taken in the Netherlands in 2019, according to its caption on Shutterstock. “Farmers block the A28 Highway with their tractors between Hoogeveen and Meppel in The Netherlands, 01 October 2019,” the image’s caption reads. “The farmers joined a national protest in The Hague.” (RELATED: Did Stacey Abrams Say, ‘We Don’t Need Farmers, When We Have Grocery Stores’?)  The 2019 protest was in response to proposed measures of reducing nitrogen emissions that some farmers felt unfairly targeted their profession, NPR reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The image is a piece of digital artwork, not a photo taken from the International Space Station. Fact Check:   The International Space Station, which orbits about 250 miles above the earth, was assembled in parts between 1998 and 2011, according to NASA. 2020 marked the International Space Station’s 20th year of astronaut crews living on it, the Associated Press reported. The Facebook post claims to show a photo of a solar eclipse taken from the International Space Station. A solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the sun and the earth and blocks the sun’s light, casting a shadow on earth, according to NASA. (RELATED: Is This Image The ‘First Ever’ Photo Of A Sunset On Mars?) While the picture does contain some actual imagery of space, it is not a photo of a solar eclipse taken from the International Space Station. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact discovered it is actually a piece of digital artwork created by Deviant Art user A4size-ska using software called Terragen 2. The image of the Milky Way in the background of the piece comes from the European Space Observatory. The inaccurate claim that the image shows a solar eclipse “viewed from the International Space Station” has circulated online since at least 2012. In an article for Discover Magazine that year, astronomer Phil Plait debunked the claim, noting that “the bright Earth (and Sun!) would wash out the background stars in a picture like this, so you’d not see them, and certainly not the Milky Way.” Gizmodo also reported that the image was a “3D rendering made in Terragen 2” by the Deviant Art user.  This isn’t the first time social media users have mistaken a piece of digital artwork as a genuine photo taken of space. In February, Check Your Fact debunked an image some Facebook users claimed to show “Earth, Venus and Jupiter as seen from Mars” that, in actuality, was computer-generated.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no record of Roberts being arrested for child trafficking, or any other charges. Fact Check:   “Breaking News! Chief Justice John Roberts has been arrested for child trafficking, plus other charges!” the July 14 Facebook post reads, citing someone named Scott Brunswick as the source of the claim. Brunswick has previously been cited as the source for other Facebook posts, including one that falsely claimed former President Donald Trump retained full control of the military. There is no evidence, however, that Roberts was arrested for child trafficking, or anything else. Check Your Fact searched press releases from the Supreme Court and the FBI, but found no mention of Roberts being arrested. Had the chief justice been arrested, major media outlets almost certainly would have reported on it, yet none have. While Supreme Court Justices are able to hold office “as long as they choose,” according to the Supreme Court’s website, they are able to be removed by impeachment. Justices can be impeached for committing “treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanors,” per the U.S. Constitution. If Roberts was arrested for child trafficking, he would likely be susceptible to an impeachment charge from Congress, but there has not been any congressional action taken against him, according to Congress.gov. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Chief Justice John Roberts With Ghislaine Maxwell)  Roberts most recently released a statement July 1 marking the end of the term, and the start of Supreme Court recess until October.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsRyan KingContributor","https://www.facebook.com/star.aquarius.731/posts/4383237421741022,https://www.facebook.com/star.aquarius.731/posts/4265374396860659,https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/pressreleases.aspx,https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel,https://news.google.com/search?q=chief%20justice%20roberts%20arrested&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/faq_general.aspx,https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript,https://www.congress.gov/search?q=%7B%22source%22%3A%22all%22%2C%22congress%22%3A%22117%22%2C%22search%22%3A%22john+roberts%22%7D,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/12/21/fact-check-photo-john-roberts-ghislaine-maxwell-jean-luc-brunel/,https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/pressreleases/pr_07-01-21",Was Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts Arrested?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The video shows soccer fans celebrating in Buenos Aires, Argentina, after the country’s team won the Copa América final against Brazil. Fact Check:    Widespread anti-government protests erupted across Cuba starting July 11, according to The Wall Street Journal. Cubans are protesting the Communist-run government, food and medicine shortages and electricity outages, among other things, the Associated Press reported. Misinformation related to the Cuban anti-government protests has circulated widely on social media in recent days. The inaccurate claim that the video, which has garnered over 1,400 views so far, shows a nighttime protest in the country “right now” is one such example. It actually shows Argentinians in Buenos Aires celebrating the national soccer team’s victory over Brazil in the Copa América final on July 10. The well-known Obelisco de Buenos Aires can be seen in the video lit up with blue lights. Similar footage shared by The Guardian’s soccer-focused Youtube channel, Guardian Football, shows a large crowd of Argentina soccer fans celebrating the July 10 win in the Plaza de la Republica, where the monument is located.   The description of Guardian Football’s video containing the similar footage reads in part, “Thousands took to the streets in Buenos Aires on Saturday night after Argentina beat its historic rival Brazil in the Copa América final.” (RELATED: Does This Photo Show An Anti-Communist Protest In Cuba?) Reuters also published footage depicting Argentina soccer fans on July 10 celebrating the win in Buenos Aires.

Fact Check:   The image includes a photo of Kayleigh McEnany surrounded by photos of Jacqueline Kennedy, John F. Kennedy, John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy. Text in the photo lists John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy as Kayleigh McEnany’s grandparents and John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy as her parents.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False The sticker has been digitally edited into the photo. Fact Check: The picture of the BMW supposedly sporting a “Fuck You Greta!” sticker on the back windshield has circulated on Facebook in recent days. The alleged sticker appears to reference Thunberg, a well-known Swedish environmental activist. The image also went viral on Twitter, where one iteration has received over 1,200 retweets and 9,000 likes as of press time.   The anti-Thunberg sticker has been photoshopped into the picture, a reverse image search revealed. The original photo, taken by photographer David Young, can be found in a July 16 article about cars that was published by the German newspaper Bild in connection to flooding in Germany. In the unaltered picture, there are no stickers visible on the car’s window. Countries in Western Europe were recently hit by deadly floods, with at least 160 people having been killed by them in Germany, according to the Associated Press. At least 31 people in Belgium have died in the floods, the outlet reported Monday. (RELATED: Image Claims To Show Greta Thunberg Eating On A Train While Children Watch From Outside) One Twitter user who shared the image later appeared to clarify that it was doctored, saying in part, “Apparently the bumper sticker is photoshopped in, which isn’t surprising since this is in Germany, so presumably it would be in German (or Belgian, Dutch) if it were real.”  Apparently the bumper sticker is photoshopped in, which isn’t surprising since this is in Germany, so presumably it would be in German (or Belgian, Dutch) if it were real.

Verdict: False The photo of the elephant has been photoshopped to include a lioness and lion cub. The image was originally created for an April Fools’ Day prank. Fact Check:   The image seemingly showing a lioness padding alongside an elephant holding a cub with its trunk has circulated online for several years. “It was considered the best photo of this century,” text inside the image states. “A lioness and her cub were crossing the savannah but the heat was excessive and the cub was in great difficulty walking. An elephant realized that the cub would die and carried him in his trunk to a pool of water walking beside his mother. And we call them wild animals.” The image is photoshopped. The unaltered picture of the elephant can be found on Wikimedia Commons. In the original photo, there are no lions accompanying the elephant as it crosses a dirt path. (RELATED: Did Russia Let Over 500 Lions Loose To Keep People Indoors During The Coronavirus Pandemic?) Kruger Sightings, an online service that shares wildlife sightings at South Africa’s Kruger National Park, first tweeted the altered picture on April 1, 2018, with a similar story accompanying it. The caption credits the photo to “Sloof Lirpa,” which is “April Fools” written backwards.  Nadav Ossendryver, the founder of Kruger Sightings, said that it was created as a 2018 April Fools’ Day prank and that it quickly went viral, according to Business Insider South Africa. Ossendryver said some media outlets reached out to him at the time asking for permission to use it, the outlet reported. Despite Kruger Sightings also posting on its website in 2018 that the photoshopped image was an April Fools joke, some social media users have continued to share it, seemingly believing it is a genuine photo of an elephant helping a lioness and her cub.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/jackmason1953/posts/10222471645914304,https://www.facebook.com/jackmason1953/posts/10222471645914304,https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Elephant_side-view_Kruger.jpg,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/03/24/fact-check-russia-500-lions-look-streets-coronavirus/,https://twitter.com/LatestKruger/status/980344432393375744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E980344432393375744%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.co.za%2Fsa-elephant-picture-fools-20-million-people-2018-4,https://www.businessinsider.co.za/sa-elephant-picture-fools-20-million-people-2018-4,https://www.latestsightings.com/single-post/2018/04/01/How-To-Make-Your-April-Fools-Joke-Go-Viral,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#deaaacbba8b1ac9ebdb6bbbdb5a7b1abacb8bfbdaaf0bdb1b3",Does This Image Show An Elephant Carrying A Lion Cub?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The video shows a religious festival in Taiwan in April, not a soccer celebration in Italy. Fact Check:   Italy’s national men’s soccer team won the 2020 European Championship after defeating England on July 11, a win that prompted celebrations across the country, according to The New York Times. Now, a July 13 video claims to show supporters of the team setting off a long line of red firecrackers in the street. “Italy’s celebration on euro cup winning,” reads the post’s caption. “No pollution for them ,only India’s Dipawali crackers pollute the world!” (RELATED: Does This Image Show Italian Police Laying Down Their Equipment In Solidarity With People Protesting COVID-19 Restrictions?) Dipawali, or Diwali, is India’s most important holiday, and is typically celebrated with a large festival in which firecrackers and fireworks are ignited, a tradition that has been criticized for contributing to air pollution, according to NPR. The Facebook video does not, however, show a celebration in Italy. Through a reverse image search of key frames, Check Your Fact found similar footage posted on YouTube in April by Taiwanese news outlet Sanli News Network with the title: “Firecrackers stretch for 500 meters to welcome Baishatun Mazu enthusiastically.”  The Baishatun Mazu (or Matsu) Pilgrimage is an annual religious festival in which tens of thousands of people walk 400 kilometers across Taiwan to honor the sea goddess Matsu, according to the Taipei Times. This year’s pilgrimage began on April 11, the outlet reported. Firecrackers are often set off along the route to celebrate the deity, according to Taiwan Panorama.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The video shows a protest in Kenya, not France. Fact Check:   The 31-second video shows an aerial view of people running in different directions on a street as two vehicles shoot water cannons at them. The caption of the video reads, “Resistance begins to mount against President Macron’s plan for mandatory COVID vaccinations of all French citizens.” (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Kenyans In Nairobi Protesting In Solidarity With Nigerians In June 2021?) That description of the video, however, is inaccurate. A keyword search of terms associated with the video turned up several YouTube videos showing the same footage, all of which indicate it actually shows a protest at the University of Nairobi in Kenya. Several landmarks in the video match those visible in a Google Maps street view of University Way, confirming the incident occurred near the University of Nairobi. Kenyan riot police have used water cannons and tear gas on multiple occasions in recent years to disperse protests in Nairobi, and it is unclear which exact demonstration the video shows. Last week, Kenyan riot police used tear gas against University of Nairobi students who were protesting the university’s decision to raise tuition fees, according to AFP. During a recent televised speech, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that due to a recent rise in COVID-19 cases in the country, vaccines would become mandatory for health care workers by September 15, according to France24. He has not mandated COVID-19 vaccines for all French citizens at the time of publication.  The French president announced in the same address that starting in August, anyone who wants to go to certain venues such as restaurants, bars and malls must have a special “health pass” documenting they have been vaccinated against COVID-19, recently tested negative for the virus or recovered from it, according to NPR. The announced rules prompted protests in parts of France, according to Reuters.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The claim appears to stem from a website that does not guarantee the “accuracy, completeness or usefulness” of its information. Fact Check:   The July 8 post includes what appears to be a screen grab of an article with a featured image showing Biden on one knee in front of Rivlin and Ravitz. The article’s headline reads: “Biden Literally Kneels Before Israeli President in Bizarre and Humiliating Display — Pledges Unconditional Support to Israel.” Biden was not, however, kneeling  before the former president as a display of “unconditional support” to Israel. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found the image published in a July 2 article by the Times of Israel. Biden knelt in front of Ravitz in awe of the fact that she has 12 children, the outlet reported. Rivlin met with Biden at the White House in late June to “reset” the relationship between Israel and the U.S., the Washington Post reported. During the meeting, Biden said his commitment to Israel is “ironclad,” according to a transcript of remarks published by the White House. (RELATED: Does This Image Show Mark Zuckerberg Holding An ‘I Stand With Israel’ Sign?) The article in the screen grab appears to have been published by the website en Volve. En Volve includes a disclaimer under the “Website Terms Of Use” section that says: “We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of this information.

Verdict: False The video has been digitally altered. The original video does not show Johnson with a black eye or any visible injury. Fact Check:   Johnson announced all remaining coronavirus restrictions in England would be lifted on July 19, despite a recent surge in COVID-19 cases, according to the Associated Press. The country began slowly lifting restrictions in March, starting with reopening schools, the outlet reported. Now, a video on Facebook seemingly shows a news segment aired on BBC News of Johnson speaking with a black eye. The video was first shared on TikTok July 12 and has over 35,000 likes and 6,100 comments. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Boris Johnson With Ghislaine Maxwell?) The video, however, appears to have been doctored to include the black eye. Check Your Fact found the original video posted on YouTube by BBC on July 12. In the original segment, Johnson is shown speaking at a press conference about England removing the last of the COVID-19 restrictions, and he does not have a black eye.   If Johnson actually gave a press briefing while having a black eye, media outlets likely would have reported on it, yet none have. In 2011, when Johnson was the mayor of London, the Evening Standard reported he showed up to vote with a black eye he received after hitting a security barrier headfirst while cycling. Over 1,200 scientists signed a letter to The Lancet criticizing Johnson’s plan to lift COVID-19 restrictions on July 19, calling the decision a “dangerous and unethical experiment,” according to The Guardian.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False The image has been digitally altered to include Wine. The original image shows Obama and the Argentinian ambassador to the U.S. in 2016. Fact Check: In the image, Obama and Wine look like they are posing for a photo in what appears to be the Oval Office of the White House. Wine wears a double-breasted suit with a red pocket square. (RELATED: Did Haitian President Jovenel Moise Say He Would Expose The Clinton Foundation The Day Before His Assassination?)   The picture, however, has been digitally altered, a reverse image search revealed. The original photo, found in a January 2016 Mendoza Post article, actually shows Obama standing with Argentina’s then-ambassador to the U.S Martín Lousteau. Wine has been digitally superimposed over Lousteau. While Check Your Fact was unable to identify the original source of the Wine photo, pictures of Wine wearing a similar suit can be found online. For example, he wore it in 2020 while wearing a face mask. He can also be seen wearing it in a photo published by The Standard. Social media users have previously spread false information about Wine and U.S. politicians. In December 2020, Check Your Fact debunked the claim that Obama and President Joe Biden tweeted “#FreeBobiWine” after Wine was arrested. Wine lost the 2021 Ugandan presidential election to long-time president Yoweri Museveni, according to CNN. Wine challenged the election results and said he had evidence of fraud, but ultimately withdrew his challenge, The Associated Press reported.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no evidence Moïse announced he would expose the Clinton Foundation. The claim appears to stem from a satirical article. Fact Check:   A team of gunmen assassinated Moïse and injured his wife in their home on July 7, the Associated Press reported. Now, an image on Facebook seemingly shows a screen grab of an article bearing the headline: “BREAKING: Haitian President Jovenel Moïse to expose Clinton Foundation fraud tomorrow.” Additional text in the image reads, “Last tuesday the president of Haiti told on msm he was gonna expose the Clinton Foundation, one day later he was dead….” Former president and then-U.N. Special Envoy to Haiti Bill Clinton and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were criticized for their performance in helping to lead recovery efforts after the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti which resulted in an estimated 220,000 deaths, according to BBC News. The Clinton Foundation drew criticism and accusations of corruption related to its involvement in aid work and funding following the disaster, the outlet reported. There is no record of Moïse telling the media he planned to reveal fraud perpetrated by the Clinton Foundation. None of the Haitian Ministry of Communication’s 2021 press releases mention the Clinton Foundation. Nor do any of Moïse’s social media posts. An internet search turned up no media reports of Moïse ever saying he was planning to “expose” the Clinton Foundation. Moïse met and spoke with Bill Clinton in September 2018 during the Bloomberg Global Business Forum in New York, and tweeted that the exchange was “a pleasure.” (RELATED: Did Haiti’s First Lady Martine Moïse Die?)  The screen grabbed article in the Facebook post appears to stem from an article published on the Genesius Times, a website that describes itself as, “The most reliable source of fake news on the planet.” While the Genesius Times clearly disclaims that the articles on its website are not factual, some social media users have been sharing the claim without such a warning, passing the information off as genuine.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=272178751373056&id=100057427993205,https://apnews.com/article/haiti-president-jovenel-moise-killed-b56a0f8fec0832028bdc51e8d59c6af2,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37826098,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37826098,https://www.communication.gouv.ht/rubrique/communiques/,https://twitter.com/search?q=%22Clinton%20Foundation%22%20(from%3Amoisejovenel)&src=typed_query,https://www.facebook.com/page/1390429167954248/search/?q=Clinton%20Foundation,https://www.google.com/search?q=Jovenel+Mo%C3%AFse+Clinton+Foundation&ei=LZDvYICdIpWp5NoPv8K38AU&oq=Jovenel+Mo%C3%AFse+Clinton+Foundation&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBQghEKsCSgQIQRgBUOkFWJYdYKYiaAFwAHgAgAFviAGaA5IBAzUuMZgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwjA5-yN9-PxAhWVFFkFHT_hDV4Q4dUDCA4&uact=5,https://twitter.com/moisejovenel/status/1044988661195051010,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/07/12/fact-check-haiti-first-lady-martine-moise-die/,https://genesiustimes.com/haitian-president-jovenel-moise-to-expose-clinton-foundation-fraud-tomorrow/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f0848295869f82b0939895939b899f858296919384de939f9d",Did Haitian President Jovenel Moïse Say He Would Expose The Clinton Foundation The Day Before His Assassination?,,,,,,
