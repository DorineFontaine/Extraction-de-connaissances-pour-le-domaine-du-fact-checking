The video from Madison Murphy (@badbroad) said that October 11 has a special significance in the history of the 1998 Lindsay Lohan movie, “The Parent Trap.”   “I don’t know who else to tell this to, so I just need you guys to listen up,” Murphy said. “All right, so we all know our Lord and Savior Chessy from ‘The Parent Trap.’ She’s played by a lady named Lisa Ann Walter. So, three years after ‘The Parent Trap’ came out, in 2001, she gave birth to twins. Not only that, but she gave birth to twins on October 11.” This led commenters to ask about the significance of the date. One person asked: “Am I the only one wondering what’s significant about October 11?” Another commenter answered: “The twin girls from the movie she’s referencing were born on October 11.” This was all true. According to the film’s script, Annie James and Hallie Parker, portrayed by actress Lindsay Lohan, were indeed born on October 11. The only thing unclear was if Walter’s twins were born in 2000 or 2001. Wikipedia, which can be edited by just about anyone, said 2001. However, the real year may have been 2000. We were able to confirm the October 11 date with a tweet from Walter’s verified Twitter account, where she said that the twins were born two years after the film’s 1998 release.  In the past, Walter posted on Instagram in celebration of her twins’ birthdays. Their names are Simon and Spencer.  Commenters responded to the October 11 revelation with “OMFG” and “Jesus, who knows that much about the f—ing ‘Parent Trap’ remake.” Someone responded to the latter comment, saying: “People who grew up with the movie, obviously.” “The Parent Trap” starred Dennis Quaid, the late Natasha Richardson, and Lindsay Lohan. The film’s plot was described as follows: In sum, it was true that October 11 had a special significance for both the fictional twins’ birthdays in “The Parent Trap” and Walter, who gave birth to twins in real life on the same month and day.","https://www.snopes.com/tag/tiktok-rumors/,https://www.awesomefilm.com/script/The-Parent-Trap.html,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Ann_Walter,https://twitter.com/LisaAnnWalter/status/891733278058622977,https://www.instagram.com/p/8uc8epB91f/",The Rumor About ‘The Parent Trap’ and October 11 Is True,Entertainment,,,,,

Underneath a caption that read “Mens beach-handball teams uniform vs. the women’s uniform,” a photograph showed what appeared to be a men’s beach handball team, wearing tank tops and shorts, kneeling and standing next to their female counterparts, who are wearing bikini bottoms and “midriff” tops:  That photograph was genuine, and showed Norway’s men’s and women’s beach handball teams, respectively, before their games against their Swedish counterparts, in June 2019. As such, we are issuing a rating of “True.” The picture was taken by the photographer Niclas Dovsjö on June 7, 2019, in Ulricehamn, Sweden. It was posted online and on Facebook by the Norwegian Handball Federation, and can be seen in its original context, below:  Norway’s men lost their encounter with Sweden, while their female compatriots won. At the time, the picture prompted an outraged response in Norway, illustrating as it did the glaring discrepancy in uniform requirements between male and female athletes.  In response to expressions of criticism at the rules, and the treatment of the Norwegian women’s team, European Handball Federation [EHF] President Michael Wiederer insisted that “the EHF will do all it can to ensure that a change of athlete uniform regulations can be implemented,” but said such a rules change “could not happen overnight.”","https://web.archive.org/web/20210721063358/https://www.ihf.info/sites/default/files/2019-05/0_09%20-%20Rules%20of%20the%20Game%20%28Beach%20Handball%29_GB.pdf,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/IHF_Uniforms.png,https://web.archive.org/web/20210721203614/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/20/sports/norway-beach-handball-team.html,https://archive.is/YuGw3,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-21-at-17.01.29.png,https://web.archive.org/web/20210721203731/https://www.handball.no/nyheter/2019/06/en-seier-og-et-tap-i-sverige/,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-21-at-17.09.15.png,https://web.archive.org/web/20210721211124/https://www.aftenposten.no/sport/i/6jVA0e/dette-bildet-skaper-reaksjoner-jeg-gremmes,https://web.archive.org/web/20210721211820/https://beacheuro.eurohandball.com/news/en/wiederer-ehf-will-do-its-utmost-to-influence-beach-handball-uniform-change/","Pic Shows Difference Between Men’s, Women’s Beach Handball Uniforms?",Sports,,,,,
2,,,,Mostly True,Madison Dapcevich,2021-07-21,,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/author/madison/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mosquitoes-blood-type-attraction/,"Evidence suggests that among other individual factors, mosquitos may be more attracted to people with Type O blood.",2021-07-21,snopes,,"As the hot 2021 summer months brought increased mosquito activity across much of the U.S., Snopes readers wanted to know if the buzzing pests were attracted to one type of blood over another. A deeper look through the scientific literature revealed that among other factors — like hormone levels or scents — there is evidence to suggest that mosquitoes may be more attracted to people with Type O blood — or at least these individuals were more likely to be bit.  To understand why these individuals are more likely to be pestered by the biting bugs, we must first understand what a blood type is.   A person’s blood type is inherited and determined by the presence or absence of substances known as antigens, which can trigger an immune response if they are foreign to the body, according to the Red Cross. The four major blood groups — A, B, AB and O —are determined by the presence or absence of two such antigens, A and B, that are found on the surface of red blood cells. But there is also a protein known as the Rh factor which is present (+) or absent (-) to make up the eight most common blood types: A+, A-, B+, B-, O+, O-, AB+ and AB-.  Type O positive is the most common with more than one-third of Americans with this type. Type O negative, on the other hand, is known as the “universal” blood type and is the most common blood type used for transfusions when a patient’s blood type is unknown. (To find out your blood type, a sample of your blood must be sampled or taken by a medical professional.)  The American Mosquito Control Association notes that there are more than 3,000 species of mosquitoes, and though host preference may vary depending on region and species, several studies have supported the claim that mosquitoes might be more attracted to those with Type O blood over others.  One such species, Aedes aegypti, is the major vector of Dengue in Sri Lanka. In 2019, scientists at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura in Sri Lanka set out to determine how certain blood types may influence a mosquito’s ability to rear offspring. Laboratory-reared female mosquitoes were exposed to all four blood groups at once in separate feeders. After feeding, the DNA of blood in mosquitoes was extracted and identified and the mean number of eggs per individual was determined. The researchers found that the highest preference was observed for the blood group O. However, no one blood type was found to influence a mosquito’s egg production over another, begging the question: Why might mosquitoes prefer one type of blood over another? (More on that later.)  A small-scale study conducted in 2004 also found that of 64 test subjects, those with blood Type O were significantly likely to have a mosquito land on them than on other blood groups A, B and AB. A 2009 study published in Virology Journal found that individuals with O+ blood type were more susceptible than other group types to get chikungunya, a virus spread to people through the bite of an infected mosquito. The findings suggested that some people may have a genetic predisposition to the disease or perhaps are more likely to be bitten and infected by virus-carrying mosquitoes.  In 1974, researchers at Oxford University found that when physiological variables were accounted for, mosquitoes preferred the blood from hosts of blood group O. But a study conducted in 2014 and published in the peer-reviewed journal Acta Tropica found that mosquitoes were more likely to feed on either artificial membrane blood feeders — or directly on human hands — of those with AB type (40%) when compared to other groups of A (24%), B (21%), and O (15%). While the latter study does not prove that mosquitoes are more inclined to bite Type O individuals, the findings further add evidence that parasites like mosquitoes may prefer certain genetic factors like blood.  Interestingly, in both of the above studies, individuals with AB blood types were shown to have more severe cases of malaria than those of other blood types — a finding that researchers suggest indicate mosquito preference could serve as a sort of natural selection for population control.  Understanding how and why mosquitoes choose a host is not just a matter of comfortability. In much of the world, it can be a matter of life or death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) calls the mosquito the “world’s deadliest animal” and credits the long-legged insect with spreading diseases like malaria, dengue, West Nile, yellow fever, Zika, chikungunya, and lymphatic filariasis. The transmission of diseases through mosquitoes kills more people than any other critter in the world. In 2017 alone, an estimated 435,000 people around the world died from malaria alone and millions more became ill with the disease.  Knowing what blood types a mosquito might be attracted to can help health experts and individuals take the necessary precautions to avoid being bit by one (more on that later). Additionally, understanding what individuals may be more likely to experience disease severity can help in the treatment of infection.  But blood type is not the only factor that may influence a mosquito’s choice in a host. Virginia Tech researchers wrote in the journal Current Biology that mosquitoes have the ability to learn which humans will be the most advantageous for feeding.  “How mosquitoes determine which individuals to bite has important epidemiological consequences. This choice is not random; most mosquitoes specialize in one or a few vertebrate host species, and some individuals in a host population are preferred over others,” wrote the study authors in 2018.  These factors can include pregnancy and hormonal fluctuations during various stages of a menstrual cycle, as well as carbon dioxide, the compounds contained in sweat, alcohol intake, and even a preexisting malaria infection. The CDC recommends wearing insect repellent, covering up with long clothing, and using screens and fans on doors and windows to avoid mosquitos.  “Mosquitoes bite during the day and night, live indoors and outdoors, and search for warm places as temperatures begin to drop. Some mosquitoes hibernate in enclosed spaces, like garages, sheds, and under (or inside) homes, to survive cold temperatures,” wrote the health agency.  For more information on mosquito-caused diseases and how to prevent them, visit the CDC’s mosquito central.","https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-types.html,https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-types/o-blood-type.html,https://www.mosquito.org/page/mosquitoinfo,http://www.sciencepublishinggroup.com/journal/paperinfo?journalid=547&doi=10.11648/j.aje.20190302.13,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15311477/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2704197/,https://www.jstor.org/stable/41459967,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001706X14002733,https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/stories/world-deadliest-animal.html,https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)31617-2,https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)31617-2,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1127358/,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-you-a-magnet-for-mosquitoes/#:~:text=Researchers%20have%20also%20found%20a,are%20more%20attractive%20to%20mosquitoes.,https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/how-mosquitoes-detect-people#:~:text=Female%20mosquitoes%20have%20nerve%20cells,the%20absence%20of%20carbon%20dioxide.,https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/how-mosquitoes-smell-human-sweat,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12083361/#:~:text=Our%20study%20demonstrated%20that%20percent,drinking%20alcohol%20stimulates%20mosquito%20attraction.,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324568250_Malaria_infection_creates_a_'human_perfume'_that_makes_us_more_attractive_to_mosquitoes,https://www.cdc.gov/media/dpk/diseases-and-conditions/mosquito-borne-diseases/index.html,https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/index.html",Are Mosquitos Attracted to a Certain Blood Type?,,,,,,

The video was accompanied by a message claiming that “thefts under $950 will not be prosecuted” thanks to California’s Proposition 47 law.   This is not true. For one, Prop 47 is not a new law. It was approved by a majority of California voters back in 2014. More importantly, Prop 47 does not legalize theft under $950.  The judicial branch of California explains on its page about Prop 47 that the new law “reclassifies certain theft and drug possession offenses from felonies to misdemeanors.” Thanks to Prop 47, shoplifting offenses involving property valued at less than $950 are prosecuted as misdemeanors, not felonies, but they are still prosecuted. Such offenses are punishable by up to six months in county jail.   The above-displayed video, which reportedly shows two people shoplifting from a TJ Maxx in Granada Hills, is one of several videos that was circulated online in the summer of 2021 in support of the claim that crime was on the rise in California. However, San Francisco Police Chief William Scott said that the statistics don’t support that narrative, pointing to a mid-year report showing that burglaries were down 6 % in the first six months of 2021. It should also be noted that California is not the only state that has raised the bar for felony convictions. Since 2000, at least 37 states have enacted laws that raised the threshold for what constitutes felony theft. In 2017, Pew Charitable Trusts examined how these laws impacted the crime rate and found that “raising the felony theft threshold has no impact on overall property crime or larceny rates.” Pew Trusts wrote: We looked at a similar claim back in 2020.

Some social media users appeared to celebrate the American team’s defeat, arguing that it was some form of competitive karma in response to the team purportedly taking a knee during the national anthem before the game:  The U.S. women’s soccer team did kneel before the opening match. However, this protest did not take place during the national anthem, and this protest was not conducted solely by the American team. The Swedish players also took a knee before kick-off. And, according to The Associated Press, players for the British, Chilean, Australian, and New Zealand teams also dropped to their knees before their respective matches: In Yahoo Sports’ article about the game, they specifically noted that all of the American players were standing for the national anthem. The image at the top of this article shows the U.S. women’s soccer team standing during the playing of the national anthem. The players knelt in protest after the playing of the anthem and but before kick-off. According to Yahoo, the protest lasted about 10 seconds, and took place as some pregame music played in the background: Several players commented on the protest in the hours after their respective matches. Steph Houghton, the captain of the British team, said: “We felt strongly as a group that we wanted to show support for those affected by discrimination and equality … It was a proud moment because the Chile players took the knee too to show how united we are as sport.” Megan Rapinoe of the U.S. women’s soccer team said: “It’s an opportunity for us to continue to use our voices and use our platforms to talk about the things that affect all of us intimately in different ways … We have people from Team USA, from all over the country, from all backgrounds, and people literally from all over the world for every other team so I obviously encourage everyone to use that platform to the best of their ability to do the most good that they possibly can in the world, especially as all eyes are on Tokyo these next couple weeks”","https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-21-113742.jpg,https://apnews.com/article/2020-tokyo-olympics-sports-race-and-ethnicity-racial-injustice-soccer-18c738309b73ef7c2237e948f1870ca7,https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/united-states-players-are-seen-during-their-national-anthem-news-photo/1329894391,https://sports.yahoo.com/olympics-soccer-players-kneel-uswnt-090330888.html,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/us-womens-soccer-team-kneel-protest-olympics-matches,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/us-womens-soccer-team-kneel-protest-olympics-matches",Did US Women’s Soccer Kneel During National Anthem at 2020 Olympic Opener?,Sports,,,,,

For example, on July 21 CBS News published an article with the headline “U.S. Life Expectancy Took ‘Catastrophic’ Hit Last Year, Biggest Since WWII,” which stated that: “U.S. life expectancy fell by a year-and-a-half in 2020, the largest one-year decline since World War II, public health officials said Wednesday.” Similar articles, each containing the “World War II” claim, were published by the New York Post, CNBC, and NPR. Those claims were accurate. According to data published by the federal U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the estimated life expectancy in 2020 was 77.3 years. In 2019, it was 78.8 years — a year-over-year decline of 1.5 years.  Based on historical CDC data, the last time U.S. life expectancy dropped by that much or more in one year was indeed during World War II, when life expectancy fell from 66.2 years in 1942, to 63.3 years in 1943 — a decline of 2.9 years. As such, we are issuing a rating of “True.” The most recent authoritative information on life expectancy in the U.S. can be found in the “Provisional Life Expectancy Estimates for 2020,” which were published on July 21, 2021, by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and can be read in full here. It stated that: Accord to the NCHS, that sharp decline in overall life expectancy at birth was largely attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic which, according to the CDC, killed almost 370,000 people in the U.S., and infected more than 20 million individuals, in 2020 alone. The report explained: The assertion that the decline in life expectancy between 2019 and 2020 was the biggest since World War II did not appear in the July 2021 estimates, but news outlets appear to have based it on remarks made by Elizabeth Arias, the lead author of the report, in a February 2021 podcast.  Back in February, the CDC took the unusual step of publishing life expectancy estimates for the first six months of the previous year (2020). At that time, the data suggested a decline of one year between 2019 and 2020, a figure that was revised upwards to 1.5 years in July, when the data for the full year of 2020 were released. Placing the sharp decline in life expectancy in historical context, Arias said: Arias’ assessment was accurate both at the time she made it, when the decline in life expectancy was estimated to be one year, and in July 2021, when that decline was estimated to be 1.5 years.  A useful visualization of life expectancy trends between 1900 and 2018 can be found on the NCHS website. It shows that, since World War II, life expectancy in the U.S. has steadily increased, with a handful of small annual declines here and there:  A comprehensive breakdown of life expectancy every year between 1900 and 2020 can be found here. It shows that in 1943, life expectancy (63.3 years) dropped by 2.9 years from 1942 (66.2 years). From that time until 2019, life expectancy experienced a year-over-year decline on only 10 occasions, with the biggest drop being 0.3 years, in 1968 and 1993.  The estimated decline of 1.5 years between 2019 and 2020 was therefore the biggest annual decline in life expectancy in the past 77 years, by a considerable distance.  The biggest single annual decline in life expectancy in the last 120 years came in 1918, when it fell from 50.9 years, in 1917, to 39.1 years — a decline of 11.8 years. In 1918, the flu pandemic caused almost 500,000 deaths in the U.S. alone.","https://archive.is/TZP02,https://archive.is/VUULH,https://archive.is/CMo0O,https://archive.is/c84Bs,https://web.archive.org/web/20210721051556/https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/VSRR015-508.pdf,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-21-at-10.42.46.png,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-21-at-10.42.28.png,https://archive.is/sx9by,https://web.archive.org/web/20210720163857/https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/VSRR10-508.pdf,https://archive.is/sx9by,https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data-visualization/mortality-trends/index.htm,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-21-at-11.48.00.png,https://www.snopes.com/uploads/2021/07/U.S.-Life-Expectancy-1900-2020-Sheet1.pdf,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/deadliest-days-usa-history/",Did US Life Expectancy in 2020 See Biggest Decline Since WWII?,"COVID-19, Editor's Picks",,,,,

So, how did he celebrate the next day? By placing a 50-piece order of Chick-Fil-A’s chicken nuggets … .. with the Larry O’Brien and his NBA Finals MVP trophies in the car with him. The image displayed above is a screenshot from a live video on Antetokounmpo’s official Instagram page in which he made the order around 11:15 a.m. after winning the best-of-seven game series, 4-2, the night before. He said: “Can I have, please, 50-piece — not 51, not 49 — minis, yes? 50. And let me have a large, no ice, half-Sprite, half-Lemonade.”  Considering that recorded evidence, we rate the claim “True.” Earlier, the footage showed him sitting in the vehicle with one of the trophies in his lap and the other between his legs on the vehicle’s floor as he excitedly sang and danced. He said he hadn’t slept at all since winning the championship the night before.  The stream then recorded the two-time, regular-season MVP supposedly trying to persuade the fast-food restaurant into giving him “free Chick-Fil-A for life” but having no luck.

(Some modern teachers would probably agree that maybe things haven’t changed so much since then after all.)  But the bottom line is that no one has ever been able to verify the authenticity of this “Rules for Teachers – 1872” list.   The earliest iteration of this list that we’ve uncovered so far dates from 1959, when it was attributed to a school principal in Manhattan named Winifred Northrup: Rules for Teachers – 1872 28 Feb 1959, Sat Redlands Daily Facts (Redlands, California) Newspapers.com This list has been reproduced in countless newspapers and books over the sixty years since then, and copies of it have been displayed in numerous museums throughout North America, with each exhibitor claiming that it originated with their county or school district.  Any evidence documenting the existence of the original list remains elusive, however. “Rules for Teachers – 1872” also been also offered in a number of different guises, such as a list of rules for sales clerks at W.T. Stewart’s department store in New York, for floor nurses in a hospital, and for the employees of a New England carriage works.  All attempts to trace this document to its origins inevitably dead end with a photocopy or printed sheet of indeterminate origin and suspiciously modern vintage.  As a point of reference, we visited a historical site in our neighborhood which included a restored 19th century schoolhouse, complete with a preserved contemporaneous list of instructions for teachers.  The items on that list were rather mundane, directing teachers to follow protocol by taking regular attendance, using the assigned texts, etc. Nothing on the list involved manual labor or bore on the moral conduct of teachers’ private lives. Perhaps this piece tells us more about our contemporary vision of life in the 1870s than it does about life in the real 1870s.

The meme does correctly state that these beds are made of cardboard and that they will be recycled after the games.  The Olympic Village has a reputation (although possibly an unfair one) for being a hotbed of sexual activities. In 2016, the Guardian reported that nearly a half million condoms were provided to the athletes during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.  With the Olympic Village’s reputation for promiscuity, and with various “social distancing” measures being enacted due to the lingering COVID-19 pandemic, many social media users assumed that the cardboard beds were some sort of anti-sex measure. But that’s not the case. These beds were designed to be more green, not to prevent sex. Rhys Mcclenaghan, an Irish gymnast competing at the 2020 Games, posted a video on Twitter debunking the notion that the beds would break with “any sudden movement.”   Long before rumors started circulating that these were “anti-sex” beds, the cardboard beds were touted as one of the ways Tokyo was attempting to make the Olympics more environmentally friendly. A news release from 2019 published on the Olympics news site “Inside the Games” detailed the specs and purpose of these cardboard beds. The bedding company Airweave said that it was providing 18,000 beds to the Olympic Village that were made from “high resistance lightweight cardboard.” The company said that the beds can hold more than 440 pounds, and that after the games the beds would be recycled.  In sum, Olympic athletes will indeed be sleeping on cardboard beds during the 2020 games.

The ads appeared to promise answers. For example, this ad appeared next to an article on the 10news.com website. The ad read: “[Pics] Drone Captures Photos We’re Not Supposed to See.” It was sponsored by the Definition.org website, which has quite the track record for misleading clickbait. The ad was hosted by the Outbrain advertising network. Clicking on the ad led to a 39-page slideshow article and a headline that read: “Drone Photos Taken In Mid Air Will Have You Feeling Uneasy.” The article contained several photographs that appeared to be shot from the air, whether by a drone, helicopter, or airplane. One claimed it showed the aftermath of a residential explosion. Another described a shot that was purportedly captured over Barcelona, Spain. We also found a picture that was said to show volcanic activity in Iceland. We clicked through all 39 pages. The article never mentioned the photograph from the ad. It was clickbait. We clicked “next page” nearly 40 times so you don’t have to. The picture in the ad was not captured high in the sky using a drone. It appeared to be shot on the ground by artist and photographer Dillon Marsh of Dillon Marsh Photography. We found no credit to Marsh on the Definition.org website. The picture showed a large birds’ nest for the sociable weaver, built on a telephone pole. The bird species lives in the Kalahari region of southern Africa. The only place they can be found in the United States is with the San Diego Zoo. The zoo described the nests built by sociable weavers as providing enough living space for an “entire colony as well as for future residents.” The nests can hold up to 400 birds and can potentially last an entire century. Nests built by the species are made from large twigs, dry grasses, straw, soft plants, cotton, fur, and fluff. The zoo also published that a “proper nesting tree has a long, smooth trunk and high branches to discourage slithering predators.” This is perhaps what makes a telephone pole the perfect trunk for sociable weavers. The nests keep the sociable weavers cool in the summer and warm on cold nights. They welcome other birds inside, such as the South African pygmy falcon, pied barbet, familiar chat, red-headed finch, ashy tit, and rosy-faced lovebird. Vultures, eagles, and owls can also sometimes be seen on top of the nests. The added company is said to make for a more secure home from predators. As for food, the zoo’s page about the sociable weaver said that they “need less water than any other bird” and that “most never take a drink.” They get their moisture from bugs. For more on the species, visit the San Diego Zoo website. Several other photographs of the nests can be viewed on the Getty Images website. In sum, an ad promised to reveal something about a strange drone photograph that “we’re not supposed to see.” The long article that resulted from the ad never mentioned the picture. In reality, it was shot from ground level and showed a massive nest built on a telephone pole by sociable weavers. Note: Photographs from Flickr are credited to Bernard Dupont and Rui Ornelas. Matt Mawson shot the Getty Images picture. The photograph in the ad, which went uncredited by the advertiser, appeared to originally be captured by Dillon Marsh.","https://www.10news.com/sports/tampa-bay-buccaneers-tom-brady-visit-white-house-to-celebrate-super-bowl-win,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nick-stahl-death-hoax/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/kevin-costner-octavia-spencer/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/car-meghan-markle-drives/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/kevin-sorbo-hercules/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/worst-fast-food-chain/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/adam-sandler-trump/,https://archive.ph/5zmX3,https://archive.ph/ljEU8,https://archive.ph/uHB1n,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2017/08/17/barcelona-van/,https://archive.ph/T2dmn,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/iceland-religions-mental-disorders/,http://dillonmarsh.com/assimilation02.html,https://www.instagram.com/dillonmarsh/,https://www.audubon.org/magazine/march-april-2014/africas-social-weaverbirds-take-communal,https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/sociable-weaver,https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/sociable-weaver,https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/cape-weavers-nest-site-in-a-telephone-pole-royalty-free-image/73553786,https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/sociable-weaver-nest-made-on-a-telephone-pole-royalty-free-image/541050808,https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/weavers-nest-on-a-power-pole-namibia-royalty-free-image/1032886702,https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/nest-of-a-weaver-bird-on-an-electricity-pole-royalty-free-image/1032886412,https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/weaver-bird-nest-kgalagadi-transfrontier-park-south-africa-news-photo/170908186","Photograph of Massive Nest on Telephone Pole, Explained",,,,,,

In July 2021, Snopes readers sent our team the below meme to verify if the blue-hued fruit existed:  While it is true that the blue java banana is real, we have to note that some websites appear to overly saturate or alter photographs of the fruit, which exaggerate the blue coloration. As such, we have rated this claim as “Mostly True” given that the photographs featured in the meme in question were likely altered to appear more vibrant.  “This fruit is not really blue! Many photos of blue java on the internet are photoshopped,” wrote rare fruit harvester Miami Fruit on its website. “As it ripens, the outer peel will turn fully yellow.”  [See also Do Swedes Really Put Bananas on Pizza?] The blue java banana belongs to the banana family of plants Musaceae, and is a cultivar, or hybrid, of two species of banana, the Musa balbisiana and Musa acuminata. Nearly all cultivated varieties of bananas and plantains are seedless, or sterile, and are propagated and cloned from the offshoots of mature plants known as pups, according to a 2015 study published in the journal Plant Gene. Native to Southeast Asia, the blue java banana can grow up to 20 feet tall, and has silvery green leaves, according to the California Rare Fruit Growers, Inc. The skin of the fruit is silvery pale blue in coloring when unripe but turns a pale yellow when ripe. And as its nickname suggests, the vanilla-like taste of the fruit pairs nicely with ice cream when eaten fresh or cooked.","https://www.reddit.com/r/BeAmazed/comments/g53l4n/the_blue_java_banana_which_is_said_to_have_the/,https://imgur.com/gallery/0wKjhrH,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/Copy-of-Rating-Overlay-Square.png,https://fb.ru/post/main-course/2019/4/3/80743,https://miamifruit.org/products/blue-java-ice-cream-banana-pre-order,https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/musaceae,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235240731500027X,https://crfg.org/?s=blue+java",Are Blue Java Bananas Real?,,,,,,

It should also be noted that reports about Osteen owning a Ferarri 458 Italia have not been verified. In fact, some news outlets that initially published this claim, such as the Houston Chronicle, have since deleted their articles.  We have not been able to find any verified reporting that Osteen owns a $325,000 Ferrari. There don’t appear to be any photographs of Osteen driving this exotic sports car, and we have not been able to find any statements from Osteen in which he talks about an exotic collection.  This rumor appears to be little more than an assumption. Osteen does have a reported net worth in the tens of millions (more on that later) and a large house in Houston, Texas. It certainly seems possible that Osteen has purchased an exotic car (or two), but so far these reports are not verified.  As for the photographs above, one (the top right image in the above-displayed meme) was originally posted to an Exotic Cars Flickr page in 2010. A spokesperson for the Exotic Car Life Flickr account told us that the photograph was taken in Coral Gables, Florida down the street from the luxury car dealership The Collection. They told us that they saw the car, which they believed to be a customized order, at one other event and provided us with numerous photographs, none of which featured Osteen. The spokesperson said: “I saw the car on another occasion at an event, no Joel Osteen was seen.”  It should also be noted that this meme features photographs of two different Ferraris. As noted above, one pic shows a custom Ferrari in 2010 in Florida. The other photograph shows a Ferrari in Zurich, Switzerland in 2013. The following video appears to be the source of the second photo:  In addition to this video’s being taken in Switzerland, not Houston, Texas, where Osteen resides, the driver can be seen toward the end of this video, and it is not Osteen.  It’s worth nothing that in 2018, an associate pastor at Osteen’s Lakewood Church was criticized for buying his wife a $200,000 Ferrari.  As these pictures went viral, a number of other claims about Osteen’s net worth were circulated on social media. One viral tweet, for example, claimed that Osteen had a net worth of more than $40 million, that he lived in a $10.5 million mansion, and that his Lakewood Church received $4.4 million in PPP Covid-19-relief loans. These claims, in general, are true. However, there’s a little nuance that should be noted.  Osteen does own a home in Houston that is valued at around $10 million, and his Lakewood Church did receive a $4.4 million PPP loan. Claims about Osteen’s net worth, however, are just estimations. We found estimates for Osteen’s net worth ranging from $40 to $100 million, which indicates that these are little more than guessing. While we can’t determine Osteen’s exact net worth, it is safe to say that he’s wealthy. The bulk of Osteen’s fortune appears to come from book sales. In addition to being a megachurch pastor and a televangelist, Osteen is also a successful author. In 2006, The New York Times reported that Osteen’s 2004 book “Your Best Life Now” sold more than 3 million hardcover copies: Osteen talked about his wealth during an interview with PennLive in 2013:","https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/osteen-ferrari.jpg,http://web.archive.org/web/20210719155332/https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Houston-Joel-Osteen-Lakewood-Church-pastor-Ferrari-16324077.php,https://www.flickr.com/photos/exoticcarlife/5019421600/in/photostream/,.com/news/houston-texas/article/Houston-Joel-Osteen-Lakewood-Church-pastor-Ferrari-16324077.php,https://houston.culturemap.com/news/real-estate/07-04-10-after-move-to-river-oaks-joel-osteen-wants-to-sell-tanglewood-land-for-11-million/#slide=0,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/osteen-coronavirus-loan/,https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Lakewood-Church-pastor-Joel-Osteen-By-the-numbers-6418086.php,https://www.inquisitr.com/1282934/joel-osteen-denies-being-a-prosperity-minister/,https://www.nickiswift.com/208920/the-most-expensive-things-joel-osteen-owns/#:~:text=Unlike%20an%20ordinary%20pastor%2C%20Joel,according%20to%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth.,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/15/business/media/religious-broadcaster-gets-rich-contract-for-next-book.html,http://pennlive.com/midstate/2013/05/joel_osteen_harrisburg_pennsyl.html","Does Joel Osteen Own a $325,000 Ferrari?",,,,,,
12,,,,False,David Emery,2017-11-14,,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/author/david-emery/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/edward-mordrake/,"A nineteenth-century British man named Edward Mordrake (also spelled ""Mordake"") was born with a rare medical condition in the form of a extra face on the back of his head.",2017-11-14,snopes,,"One of the more interesting historical nuggets to cross our transom in recent years is the claim that a certain English gentleman of the nineteenth century named Edward Mordrake (or “Edward Mordake,” according to older sources) was born with a bizarre medical condition so troubling that it drove him to suicide:   Albeit popularized in the 2000s via memes, songs, and TV shows, the Edward Mordrake story isn’t of recent origin, having aroused the morbid interests of Victorian readers more than a century ago in Gould and Pyle’s Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine, first published in 1896. This is how the authors of that hefty volume recounted it: Despite the credulous reception the story has frequently received, there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical. For one, the entire passage about Edward Mordrake was quoted from what the authors describe as “lay sources” (more about which later), which sets it apart from other entries (such as their account of the life of Joseph Merrick, the “Elephant Man”) drawn from actual medical case histories. For another, it is heavy on melodrama (e.g., “he was kept from his rest at night by the hateful whispers of his ‘devil twin,’ as he called it”), while giving only the slightest nod to science (apart from applying the now-antiquated medical classification “bicephalic monsters,” there is really no scientific verbiage at all). And although it purports to cite two attending physicians, “Manvers and Treadwell,” a critique of the entry in the 1906 edition of The Theosophical Review reported that the names appeared nowhere in the Dict. of National Biography (a Victorian-era Who’s Who). The origin of the black-and-white photograph purporting to show Edward Mordrake and his “devil twin” in profile (which has appeared in Internet postings since 2007) is unknown. Despite its “vintage” appearance, the image exhibits greater resolution and clarity than what is typically seen in photographic reproductions of the mid-to-late Victorian era (e.g., the 1889 photograph of Joseph Merrick published in the British Medical Journal). It appears, in fact, to be a retouched photo of a wax figure in the Panoptikum Wax Museum in Hamburg, Germany: A Case of Asymmetrical Conjoined Twins? There does exist a real medical condition, Craniopagus parasiticus, whose symptoms bear a very basic resemblance to those described in this case. It’s an extremely rare complication in conjoined twins wherein one of the pair is underdeveloped and less than fully functional (hence “parasitic”), and takes the form of a vestigial head attached to the cranium of the “autositic” (dominant) twin. According to a 2016 case report, there have only been ten or fewer recorded cases of Craniopagus parasiticus in history, “of which only three survived past birth and were documented in the literature.” Of those three, two died before the age of two, despite surgical attempts to save the life of the autositic twin. The third, known famously as the “two-headed boy of Bengal,” lived to be four years old and was reported to be in good health until he was bitten by a cobra and died. Most significantly, as regards the Edward Mordrake case, conjoined twins are by definition genetically identical, so they are always of the same sex. The “devil twin” described in that case was female, while the autositic twin was male (though it could be argued, of course, that the vestigial face was misidentified as female). That the “sneering” face had no audible voice comports with such information as we have on real cases of Craniopagus parasiticus, but the claims that it exhibited “every sign of intelligence” and taunted the poor man with “hateful whispers” do not. Accounts of the two-headed boy of Bengal said the vestigial face in that case could “grimace” and its eyes were observed moving, for example, but though there could have been some sort of rudimentary consciousness present there were no signs of intelligence. Alternatively, it has been suggested that Mordrake might have suffered instead from a congenital defect known as Diprosopus (or craniofacial duplication), in which facial features are duplicated to a greater or lesser extent on other areas of the head (in the rarest cases, the full face is duplicated). The mechanisms behind this deformity aren’t fully understood, although many researchers believe it to be another rare form of conjoined twinning. Although somewhat more common than Craniopagus parasiticus (with just under 50 instances documented since the mid-nineteenth century), Diprosopus has a similarly poor survival rate, with most cases ending in stillbirth. In short, although science does offer theoretical explanations for Mordrake’s condition, they are few and only marginally plausible. About Those “Lay Sources” Gould and Pyle reported in 1896 that the “well-known story of Edward Mordake” they quoted was taken from “lay sources” — plural — despite the fact that there was really only one. Science historian Alex Boese has traced the quoted text, verbatim, to a syndicated newspaper article written in 1895 by Charles Lotin Hildreth, a poet and author of speculative fiction: What all these “wonders of science” had in common, Boese points out, is that no mention of them is to be found in any previous sources. None. It appears, in other words, that Hildreth simply made them up. Albeit couched as nonfiction, the article was actually a work of speculative fiction in the spirit of other scientific hoaxes of the time, such as the infamous life-on-the-moon hoax of 1835 and the Cardiff Giant hoax of 1869. Boese concludes — convincingly, we find — that Edward Mordrake was the literary creation of Charles Lotin Hildreth. He never really existed.","https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/11/edward-mordrake.jpg,https://www.memecenter.com/fun/2008989/edward-mordrake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGci5Tlur9o,http://americanhorrorstory.wikia.com/wiki/Edward_Mordrake,https://books.google.com/books?id=4k1rAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA188#v=onepage&q&f=false,https://books.google.com/books?id=4k1rAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA189#v=onepage&q&f=false,https://books.google.com/books?id=sowkAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA363#v=onepage&q&f=false,https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Josephmerrick1889.jpg,https://youtu.be/2yIeG4Ldp4M?t=66,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5134060/,https://web.archive.org/web/20080327214927/www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/148/the_twoheaded_boy_of_bengal.html,http://hoaxes.org/weblog/comments/edward_mordake,https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/moon-shot-race-a-hoax-and-the-birth-of-fake-news,https://www.livescience.com/55787-cardiff-giant.html","Edward Mordrake, the Man with Two Faces",medical anomalies,,,,,

These images are frequently accompanied by a piece of text about honey mushrooms, such as this paragraph that went viral when it was posted to Facebook in May 2021: “Giant mushroom, Oregon ……… Armillaria ostoyae, commonly known as the honey mushroom, is bigger than most animals, and is considered the largest and oldest organism on Earth. The mushroom covers 3,726563 m 2 of Malheur National Forest, Oregon, and is estimated to be around 8,650 years old.” While Armillaria ostoyae is a real mushroom and is considered to be one of the largest and oldest organisms on earth, it is not pictured in these images. The above-displayed images are the result of photo manipulation.  The “largest mushroom in the world” may conjure up images similar to the giant individual mushrooms shown in these viral photographs. However, Armillaria ostoyae‘s impressive growth takes place across (and under) the ground, not up into the air. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) writes that this “humongous fungus” is spread out across thousands of acres of the Malheur National Forest. Since this is a single organism, it is considered to be the largest mushroom in the world, but photographs of this humongous fungus are not quite as impressive as the fake photos shown above. Here’s a genuine picture of Armillaria ostoyae from the USDA:  The BBC explained: As for these digitally edited works of fantastical fungus, we’ve been able to track down the source of one of them. The image showing a group of people staring up at a humongous fungus was created circa 2000 by a fungal biology student at the University of California, Berkeley. This image was created as a joke by Dirk Redecker, who is now a microbiologist and curator for the International Bank for the Glomales (an order of symbiotic fungi) at the French National Institute for Agricultural Research. We reached out to Redecker for comment and will update this article if more information becomes available.  When Waffles at Noon reached out to Tom Bruns, Professor Emeritus of Fungal Ecology at Berkeley, for more information about this photo, he identified the mushroom as “Boletus photoshopus” and noted that it was pictured in its natural habitat, the digital photo. Bruns elaborated on the origins of this image in an email to Snopes. Bruns told us that this fake image was made circa 2000 as a “fun lab portrait.” Bruns and his then-student Redecker used an image of a Boletus rex-veris, a mushroom that stands about 8 inches tall, to create the giant mushroom pictured in this image. Bruns said: We have not been able to source the second image. However, we can say with absolute certainty that it is not a genuine photo of a fantastically large fungus. In fact, the Malheur National Forest has commented on this fake photo, writing: “Every few months a new crazy giant mushroom image shows up on social media referring to the Humongous Fungus on the Malheur National Forest. While it is true the fungus is the largest living organism it looks nothing like this.”","https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/giant-mushrooms.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10220626239988363&set=a.3959974040203,https://web.archive.org/web/20190803005438/https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsbdev3_033146.pdf,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/worlds-largest-mushroom.jpg,http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141114-the-biggest-organism-in-the-world,http://science.redeckeria.org/monsterbolete1b.jpg,http://wafflesatnoon.com/debunking-the-worlds-largest-mushroom-photo/",The World’s Largest Mushroom Looks Nothing Like These Viral Images,,,,,,

The ads appeared to promise a handy bathroom trick. For example, this ad appeared next to an article on the New York Post website. The ad read: “[Pics] Always Place a Toilet Paper Roll Under the Toilet Seat at Night, Here’s Why.” It was sponsored by the Maternity Week website. Clicking on the ad led to a 41-page slideshow article and a headline that read: “These 40 Brilliant Tricks Will Make Even The Hardest Items To Clean Sparkle.” The story’s first page read as follows: On that first page, the story once again teased some grand trick with a cardboard toilet paper roll, perhaps involving a toilet seat and nighttime. The web address (URL) even mentioned the toilet paper trick for what is known as UTM tracking. This meant that the website’s creator was tracking whether the ad was successfully getting clicks and bringing in readers. After all, someone was apparently paying to run the ads on the Outbrain advertising network, so it’s typically important to figure out if they’re worth the investment. The article contained several odd household tricks. One claimed it would be good to put hairbrushes in the dishwasher. Another advised about pouring various liquids down the drain, which we covered in two previous fact checks about dish soap and salt. We also found a questionable oven cleaning tip, plus purported bread uses, which we also covered in the past. On page 41, which was the last page, a toilet paper roll trick was finally revealed. However, it had nothing to do with placing it under a toilet seat at night. It simply advised to attach a cardboard roll to a vacuum cleaner hose to reach crevices. The 41-page article never mentioned a word about why to always place a toilet paper roll under a toilet seat at night. It was nothing but clickbait. We clicked “next page” 40 times so you don’t have to.

The video, which was produced by 60 Second Docs and translated from Portuguese to English via subtitles, included this narration by the artist, Duda Lozano:  As you can see, the video included multiple instances in which hands rubbed or touched the tattoos to seemingly prove that they were flat on someone’s skin instead of textured like actual embroidered patches. To investigate further, we studied the artist’s Instagram and Facebook pages, where he posted numerous images and videos of the “embroidery tattoos” over the course of months. One video in which he was tagged presumably showed his work being stretched out across someone’s skin as it was rubbed, proving the tattoos lacked depth that would make them 3-dimensional. Another clip apparently showed him in the process of giving an “embroidery tattoo” using a standard tattoo machine and other tools to make the permanent body modification. Snopes also found profiles by INKED, a magazine that highlights trends in the industry, and My Modern Met that highlighted Lozano’s pieces — evidence that, again, confirmed the realness and credibility of his art. The latter publication — which aims to promote “visually stunning images” across a variety of platforms, such as photography and science, according to its bio — stated: We reached out to Lozano to learn more about how he created the optical illusions. We will update this page if we hear back. Nonetheless, we found no evidence of any digital manipulation or Lozano using practices that would not apply to other types of tattooing, such as neo-realism or traditional line work. (In fact, based on his social media pages, he was also capable of those styles.) For those reasons, and considering the evidence outlined above, it is “True” that the so-called “embroidery tattoos” are authentic body modifications that look like 3-dimensional stitched patches but are actually flat on people’s skin, like all other tattoos.

You understand that, Mr. President?""",2021-07-20,snopes,,"On July 20, 2021, NFL quarterback Tom Brady and his Tampa Bay Buccaneers teammates visited President Joe Biden at the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl victory earlier in the year. The event was memorable for a few reasons. For one, it was the first time Brady visited the White House since 2005 (he didn’t attend the ceremonies for his Super Bowl victories during the tenures of former presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump). And two, Brady made a topical joke before presenting Biden with a jersey: “I think about forty percent of people still don’t think we won … ”  This is a genuine quote from Brady.  Brady spoke for a few minutes before he gifted a Buccaneers jersey to Biden. The seven-time champion spoke about team work and unity and hard work, but he also managed to offer up a few humorous lines. At one point, Brady referenced the number of people who continue to believe the falsehood that Biden did not win the 2020 presidential election, comparing it to the people who are in still in disbelief about the Buccaneers victory. Later, Brady joked about how he was labeled “Sleepy Tom” after screwing up a play, an apparent reference to the “Sleepy Joe” nickname that former President Donald Trump bestowed on his political rival.  Below is a transcript of Brady’s remarks. The relevant passages are in bold: Here’s a video of Brady’s remarks:  Brady has won seven Super Bowl rings during his time in the NFL. While he’s made a few appearances at the White House, this is his first visit since 2005.

The screenshot below shows just a selection of posts from Facebook in the summer of 2021 alone, demonstrating its popularity on that platform:  In reality, Biden had made no such announcement, and the claim at the center of all those social media posts was entirely fabricated. In fact, the article in question was labelled “satire” by its original authors, and as such, we are issuing a rating of “Originated as Satire.” A significant irony exists in the fact that those chiefly responsible for spreading the false and inflammatory story belong to a movement — COVID-19, anti-vaccine and “New World Order” conspiracy theorists — which so vocally emphasizes the importance of “doing your own research.” In this case, just a few seconds of research would have revealed the true origins of the bogus “Covid camps” story, since the screenshots all included the name of the website that published the article — ValueWalk.com:  On that site, those intrepid researchers would have found the article, originally posted on June 21, 2021:  If they read to the end, they would also have found the following: “Disclaimer: This is a satirical article.” The original piece was published on June 17 by TheStonkMarket.com, a website that describes its output as satirical, as follows: “TheStonkMarket.com is a financial satire site.” The “Covid camps” episode illustrates vividly the ease with which purportedly satirical content can be stripped of labels identifying it as such and deployed as inflammatory, and even harmful misinformation, that readers, without the immediate benefit of those original disclaimers, take very seriously indeed.","https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/Copy-of-Rating-Overlay-Square-65.png,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/Copy-of-Rating-Overlay-Horizontal-20.png,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/Copy-of-Rating-Overlay-Horizontal-21.png,https://archive.is/cS2Gt,https://archive.is/rVvIa,https://www.facebook.com/search/photos?q=%22Announces%20Americans%20Not%20Vaccinated%20Before%202022%22&sde=AbrfJMmWuFFQA3Ky3H_gHAI5YOGYARrs_r9mzWCyf3br0SfeobAATRBrNjilIsqXJwH3ydPhfBvpMjSxdnpjU8IubLH6rjBs-tfssrHRVIfPXY-qVrAsuorg87OcE8rfDHNMcW2KE0XoYZu38KnLWBf1QKJm7dOGwDiwldRf1JWqTg&filters=eyJycF9jcmVhdGlvbl90aW1lOjAiOiJ7XCJuYW1lXCI6XCJjcmVhdGlvbl90aW1lXCIsXCJhcmdzXCI6XCJ7XFxcInN0YXJ0X3llYXJcXFwiOlxcXCIyMDIxXFxcIixcXFwic3RhcnRfbW9udGhcXFwiOlxcXCIyMDIxLTFcXFwiLFxcXCJlbmRfeWVhclxcXCI6XFxcIjIwMjFcXFwiLFxcXCJlbmRfbW9udGhcXFwiOlxcXCIyMDIxLTEyXFxcIixcXFwic3RhcnRfZGF5XFxcIjpcXFwiMjAyMS0xLTFcXFwiLFxcXCJlbmRfZGF5XFxcIjpcXFwiMjAyMS0xMi0zMVxcXCJ9XCJ9In0%3D,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-20-at-13.50.50.png,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/Copy-of-Rating-Overlay-Vertical-26.png,https://archive.is/ggzoz,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/Copy-of-Rating-Overlay-Square-66.png,https://archive.is/7CyeF,https://archive.is/rJQwc","No, Biden Did Not Say Unvaccinated Americans ‘Will Be Put in Camps’",,,,,,

The facility was reported to be operational since late May. Snopes readers shared right-wing media outlet Gateway Pundit’s post about the reported housing of asylum seekers with us. The post claimed that Homewood Suites in Scottsdale was operating as an “illegal immigrant safehouse.” The headline also stated, “Discovered: Migrant Safe House in Scottsdale, Arizona! – ICE and Gov. Agents provide 24/7 security and catering to Illegal Immigrants.” Many asked us if the operation of housing asylum seekers was illegal.  We looked into the circumstances surrounding the use of the facilities, and learned that while families are indeed being temporarily housed in a former Homewood Suites in Scottsdale, Arizona, this is legal, and the facility is no longer officially part of the Hilton hotel chain. Real estate investment trust Woodbridge Holdings, which owns the former hotel, signed a contract with the nonprofit group Endeavors to manage the space as a temporary holding facility for families seeking asylum until at least Sept. 30, 2021. It is not clear yet what will happen after the contract is up, though one report says Woodbridge Holdings is trying to sell the property. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in turn had contracted with Endeavors to manage the temporary housing. According to Endeavors, the former hotel in Scottsdale would house asylum-seeking families for no more than 72 hours. The nonprofit would connect the migrants with U.S. sponsors, and give them transportation to bus stations or airports so they could reach their final destination. While many online claimed that Homewood Suites in Scottsdale was housing the asylum seekers, this particular facility was no longer part of Hilton hotels, which is the larger entity Homewood Suites is associated with. A Hilton spokesperson told us: Woodbridge Hospitality has filed for bankruptcy, and since May 2020, has defaulted on mortgage payments. According to reporting from May 2021, the group has been trying to close a sale of the property with a company that wanted to convert it into an apartment complex. Woodbridge’s lawyers said in court that they expect the sale to be finalized by September.  An ICE spokesperson gave us the following statement: The contract with Endeavors uses around $86.9 million in funds, provides support through Sept. 30, and provides 1,239 beds for emergency temporary shelter and other basic needs in facilities across the southwest border for families seeking asylum. It is not clear how much of these funds are going to the facility in Scottsdale. While ICE reportedly will provide access to medical and mental healthcare, cleaning facilities, hygiene kits, clothing, meals, and individual rooms to allow for social distancing, this has not been independently verified.  Traci Gomez, Chief Development and Communications Officer at Endeavors told us that they had been working with the US government to provide assistance after a rapid influx of migrants at the southern border earlier this year. Gomez added that they had experience with “safely operating shelters in a hotel setting in the COVID environment.”  “The work we do is wholly guided by ICE. Migrant families are placed in hotels to test for COVID, quarantined as necessary as well as provided with complete immigration processing that could not be accomplished at overcrowded Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) facilities. Families are normally in hotel facilities for 2-3 days as they continue processing,” Gomez said.  Meanwhile, the city of Scottsdale also addressed the protests and the use of the facility in a statement on its official website: While details about all the families within the facility are not known, newly arrived families in the U.S. are within their legal rights to seek asylum. According to the UNHCR, non-U.S. citizens who are physically present or arrive in the country may apply for asylum.  Given that ICE, the city of Scottsdale, and numerous news reports have confirmed the operating of this temporary facility for asylum seekers, and it is no longer part of Homewood Suites, we rate this claim as a “Mixture.”","https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/scottsdale-breaking/2021/06/02/hundreds-protest-hotel-turned-migrant-holding-facility-scottsdale/7518494002/,https://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/news/temporary-immigration-facility-in-scottsdale,https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/06/discovered-migrant-safe-house-scottsdale-arizona-ice-gov-agents-provide-24-7-security-catering-illegal-immigrants/,https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/scottsdale-breaking/2021/06/02/hundreds-protest-hotel-turned-migrant-holding-facility-scottsdale/7518494002/,https://archive.li/ZrEIa#selection-465.63-465.109,https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/scottsdale-breaking/2021/06/02/hundreds-protest-hotel-turned-migrant-holding-facility-scottsdale/7518494002/,https://www.hilton.com/en/homewood/,https://archive.li/ZrEIa#selection-465.63-465.109,https://sam.gov/opp/344bbe2d8fdd48dd9a0d5c5cfe206cde/view?keywords=&sort=-modifiedDate&index=&is_active=true&page=1&date_filter_index=0&inactive_filter_values=false&organization_id=100012075,https://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/news/temporary-immigration-facility-in-scottsdale,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/biden-86-million-hotels/,https://www.unhcr.org/591da86b4.pdf",Is an Arizona Hotel Being Used as an Illegal Safe House For ‘Illegal Immigrants’?,,,,,,

The posts always refer to the object as a “Siberian bear-hunting suit” and largely date it to the 19th century, as shown in the example below:  The remarkable photograph, and its description as a Siberian bear-hunting suit from the 19th century, enjoyed a boost online in 2012, after it was featured on the popular, and now defunct, website Retronaut:  It has even inspired a song, entitled “Bear Hunting Armor,” which was released by the Prague-based indie band Ending, in 2018. The music video, whose imagery clearly borrows heavily from the now-famous photograph, can be watched below. The band itself described the song as having been “Inspired by a Siberian bear hunting armor from the 1800s.” In reality, conclusive evidence is not available as to the precise origins of the costume — its purpose, creation date, or the geographical and cultural milieu from which it emerged — although it is a real historical artifact and the widely shared photograph of it is authentic. Moreover, good reasons exist to doubt the accuracy of the “Siberian bear-hunting” explanation that has become popular. As such, we are issuing a rating of “Unproven.” If decisive evidence emerges, we will update this fact check accordingly. The picture in question appears to have been taken by Malcolm Kirk, a renowned New York-based photographer. In 2012, the Victorian Adventure Enthusiast blog wrote about the artifact, claiming to have confirmed with Kirk’s representatives that he did indeed take the photograph. As of July 2021, the suit itself was housed at the Menil Collection in Houston, Texas — a museum that contains the private art and artifact collection of the French-American de Menil family. The museum’s website features various photographs of the costume, which is on display as part of the “Witnesses to a Surrealist Vision” exhibit:  The Menil Collection describes the exhibit, which first opened in 1999, as follows: So we know the suit is real, who owns it, and where it has been on display for the past 20 years, and we know that the widely shared photograph of it is authentic, as well as the name of the photographer who captured it. However, the precise origins of the costume remain elusive.  In her 2014 master’s thesis, available in full here, Kristen Strange at Arizona State University wrote at length, and in considerable detail, about “Witnesses to a Surrealist Vision.” As part of her research, she examined records relating to the acquisition of the costume, which was also frequently referred to as “Wildman,” as well as correspondence involving Dominique de Menil, a co-founder of the museum along with her husband, John; their daughter, Adelaide de Menil; and Edmund Carpenter, Adelaide’s husband and an American anthropologist who initially curated the exhibit. Despite her extensive examination of those documents and records, Strange found no evidence to definitively pin down the exact origins of the suit, but did discover some interesting background information, and clues that the outfit might actually have originated in 18th or 19th century Germany or Switzerland, rather than 19th century Russia. She wrote: While the true origins of The Wildman remain uncertain, it appears that it was being described as a bear-hunting suit as early as 1998, and possibly before that. In November of that year, the renowned conservator Barbara Appelbaum wrote an email to her colleagues at the Global Conservation Forum, looking for advice on the use of Beva, a specialist adhesive popular among conservators.  In her email, she described the artifact she was working on at that time in terms that strongly suggest it was The Wildman, especially since her email came just months before the “Witnesses to a Surrealist Vision” exhibit first opened at the Menil Collection. However, it should be noted that in her email, Appelbaum cast doubt on the “bear-hunting” description of the item:","https://archive.is/6UHzs,https://archive.is/7Xmz9,https://archive.is/xAGZv,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/Copy-of-Rating-Overlay-Square-64.png,https://archive.is/wcQlE,https://web.archive.org/web/20120724085816/http://www.retronaut.co/2012/07/siberian-bear-hunting-armour-c-1800s/,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/Copy-of-Rating-Overlay-Vertical-25.png,https://archive.is/5EZbn,https://web.archive.org/web/20120827205358/http://malcolmkirk.com/site/about,https://archive.is/lM8ti,https://archive.is/3xTGT,https://archive.is/DL5tU,https://web.archive.org/web/20161212233610/https://www.menil.org/collection/5137-witnesses,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-20-at-12.20.00.png,https://web.archive.org/web/20210720164019/https://repository.asu.edu/attachments/134945/content/Strange_asu_0010N_13845.pdf,https://archive.is/IxuzG,https://web.archive.org/web/20210713074650/https://cool.culturalheritage.org/byform/mailing-lists/cdl/1998/1372.html",Is This Bizarre Costume a ‘Siberian Bear-Hunting Suit’?,,,,,,

However, the wording of this caption left some people with the wrong impression of this shark’s age.  This shark is not 80 million years old. Not even close. While the exact lifespan of a frilled shark is unknown (these sharks are difficult to study as they live some 2,000 feet below the ocean’s surface), one estimate holds that this species lives for about 25 years.  So why the huge discrepancy? The 80 million figure refers to how long this species’ ancestors, not this individual shark, have been swimming in Earth’s deep waters. The frilled shark is often referred to as a “living fossil” because its lineage can be traced back more than 80 million years. National Geographic explained: While today’s frilled sharks resemble the fossils of their 80 million-year-old ancestors, the Smithsonian Institution’s Ocean Initiative writes that they aren’t entirely identical: The above-displayed video was taken in 2007 off the coast of Japan by a staff member of the Awashima Marine Park. This “living fossil” was about 5 feet long and died shortly after it was caught.

At the time, it was going viral as if it showed how peanut butter was being sold in Ohio.   The origins of this peanut butter packaging was again mislabeled. So where does this photograph come from? It was originally posted on May 28, 2021, by Facebook user Dane Moses Greaves, who identifies as being from from Trinidad and Tobago. The original post also added some context. Greaves writes that a friend reported he sold loose peanut butter at a grocery store in that country in the Arima region. This seemed implausible to Greaves, so the friend sent a photograph to prove it was real: While many people may be used to buying peanut butter by the jar, selling loose peanut butter by weight isn’t unprecedented. Grocery stores used to sell the item by the pound. A grocery store in Pennsylvania sold it for 20 cents a pound in 1919. While it’s not as common today, loose peanut butter can still be purchased by weight in some parts of the world.

And after footage of the glass octopus went viral online, the exploration agency took to social media on July 10 to “clear up” facts about the deep-sea animal.  Spotted at a depth of over 2,100 feet at an underwater mountain known as a Seamount, relatively little is known about the species known scientifically as Vitreledonella richardi. This is in large part due to its deep marine home — most of what is known about V. richardi has been deduced by specimens found in the stomachs of its predators. Very few records exist and until now, there has been limited footage of the glass octopus. “The Ocean holds wonders and promises we haven’t even imagined, much less discovered,” said Wendy Schmidt, co-founder of Schmidt Ocean Institute, in a news release. “Expeditions like these teach us why we need to increase our efforts to restore and better understand marine ecosystems everywhere — because the great chain of life that begins in the ocean is critical for human health and wellbeing.” The footage was captured by E/V Falkor, a research vessel operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute that conducts mapping surveys, collects live video footage, and conducts experiments to better understand the marine world. The vessel was exploring the Winslow reef complex on Tokelau Ridge in Phoenix Islands Archipelago, a remote region in the South Pacific about halfway between Hawaii and Fiji. This group of eight atolls and two submerged coral reefs encompasses a protected area that measures about the size of California and is rife with a diversity of marine life. Among the many species captured on live video were two sightings of glass octopuses, which the World Register of Marine Species noted was first described by Parisian marine biologist Louis Joubin in 1918. The pelagic octopus swims through the ocean far above the seafloor and is thought to be one of the least studied cephalopods, largely because the animal is so elusive, according to a 2016 study published in the journal Marine Biodiversity Records. So named for its nearly transparent body, the only features of the octopus that are not clear are the optic nerve, eyeballs, and digestive tract. Additionally, cells known as chromatophores use pigmentation to create color for camouflage and can be seen in the video in the form of yellow dots throughout the web and arms of the animal.  The International Union for Conservation of Nature classified the glass octopus as a species of “least concern.” With a mantle that can reach up to 4.3 inches for a total length of about 18 inches from tip to arm, the deep-sea cephalopod is also characterized by its elongated eyes that look rectangular from one side. With a lens at one end and a retina on the other, this unique eyeball makeup paired with its transparent body cast a small shadow to predators below. “Working with scientists and local researchers, this expedition is a remarkable example of the frontiers of science and exploration that we are able to support,” said Jyotika Virmani, executive director of Schmidt Ocean Institute. “Live-streaming the dives gives us a glimpse of rarely seen and fascinating creatures such as the transparent glass octopus. By providing this platform to further the understanding of our ocean, we trigger the imagination while helping to push forward scientific insights and the protection of our underwater world.”","///Users/madisondapcevich_snopes/Library/Mobile%20Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/200987851942761,https://schmidtocean.org/scientists-explore-seamounts-in-phoenix-islands-archipelago-gaining-new-insights-into-deep-water-diversity-and-ecology/,http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=141962#sources,https://mbr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41200-016-0041-6,https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/cephalopod-camouflage-cells-and-organs-of-the-144048968/,https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/162988/961420",Is This Glass Octopus Real?,,,,,,

The only problem: The sound was fake.  The “I am your father” audio was not from a 1980 audience reaction to the scene. Further, it appeared that a mention of “Luke” had been added into the scene between “no” and “I am your father.” The sound of audience members gasping and saying “no!” appeared to be captured in a movie theater during an important and spoiler-filled scene near the end of 2018’s “Avengers: Infinity War.” The same reaction heard in the doctored video above at the 0:57 mark can be listened to in the video below beginning at the 25:40 point:  The misleading “Star Wars” video has also been endlessly reposted on TikTok, earning an unknown number of total views. Unfortunately, the doctored and very viral video overshadowed a real recording from the film’s initial release. It was captured on audio cassettes inside a movie theater in 1980. That genuine recording was combined with video of the “I am your father” scene, and begins at the 4:10 mark in the video below:  The video only had 29,000 views, around 310 times less than the fake clip. The real audience reaction seemed to feature silence and shock at Darth Vader‘s famous line, perhaps with audience members not knowing if he was telling Luke Skywalker the truth. The 1980 audio cassette recording was first posted in 2011 by the user morgands1 on the website originaltrilogy.com, who also purportedly recorded audio of an audience reacting to 1977’s “Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope“: As previously mentioned, there also appeared to be a real audio recording from a 1977 screening of “Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.”  YouTube user William Forsche posted the audio in 2013. The audio recording captured his mother’s reaction as well. “Hearing her laugh (@ 0:42 & @ 2:54) and cheer with me and the rest of the audience is absolutely priceless to me,” Forsche said. Perhaps the most priceless moments of Forsche’s recording came when Han Solo swooped in to save the day and also at the end of the clip when moviegoers could be heard walking to their cars after the movie ended. Forsche said: “You can also hear me making laser beam sounds at the end of this recording, because ‘Star Wars’ got me all fired up!” As for the rumor about “The Empire Strikes Back,” in sum, the viral video that claimed to feature a 1980 cinema audience reacting loudly to “I am your father” was fake. However, a real audio recording from 1980 really does exist, but the audience was quiet, not vocal, after Darth Vader‘s pivotal line of dialogue.","https://www.snopes.com/ap/2020/11/29/dave-prowse-actor-who-played-darth-vader-dies-at-85/,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2018/07/31/draft-poster-empire-strikes-back-sells-26400/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/goodwill-executives-arrested/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZCo_hZLyh0,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/disney-trademark-norse-gods/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DzVIafBMpE&t=1536s,https://www.snopes.com/news/2021/07/07/star-wars-proposal-trailer-video/,https://www.tiktok.com/@beaaannnnzzzzz/video/6986442752363957510,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMGnKhxhTWg&t=245s,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/vatican-nativity/,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2020/01/13/arizona-store-gives-star-wars-record-back-to-mark-hamill/,https://originaltrilogy.com/topic/ESB-70mm-Soundtrack-1980-in-theatre-recording-Released/id/12501,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxBafn2t5v4,https://www.snopes.com/articles/347898/raiders-of-the-lost-ark-easter-eggs/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxBafn2t5v4,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/billy-dee-williams-mark-hamill/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMGnKhxhTWg&t=245s,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/james-earl-jones-star-wars-london-segregation/","The ‘I Am Your Father’ 1980 Audience Reaction Video Is Fake, But We Found a Real One","Entertainment, Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back",,,,,

The video, which was produced by 60 Second Docs and translated from Portuguese to English via subtitles, included this narration by the artist, Duda Lozano:  As you can see, the video included multiple instances in which hands rubbed or touched the tattoos to seemingly prove that they were flat on someone’s skin instead of textured like actual embroidered patches. To investigate further, we studied the artist’s Instagram and Facebook pages, where he posted numerous images and videos of the “embroidery tattoos” over the course of months. One video in which he was tagged presumably showed his work being stretched out across someone’s skin as it was rubbed, proving the tattoos lacked depth that would make them 3-dimensional. Another clip apparently showed him in the process of giving an “embroidery tattoo” using a standard tattoo machine and other tools to make the permanent body modification. Snopes also found profiles by INKED, a magazine that highlights trends in the industry, and My Modern Met that highlighted Lozano’s pieces — evidence that, again, confirmed the realness and credibility of his art. The latter publication — which aims to promote “visually stunning images” across a variety of platforms, such as photography and science, according to its bio — stated: We reached out to Lozano to learn more about how he created the optical illusions. We will update this page if we hear back. Nonetheless, we found no evidence of any digital manipulation or Lozano using practices that would not apply to other types of tattooing, such as neo-realism or traditional line work. (In fact, based on his social media pages, he was also capable of those styles.) For those reasons, and considering the evidence outlined above, it is “True” that the so-called “embroidery tattoos” are authentic body modifications that look like 3-dimensional stitched patches but are actually flat on people’s skin, like all other tattoos.

Snopes readers emailed us asking about a post seen on Facebook from a Qanon conspiracy theory website containing the headline, “VIDEO: HORRIFIC! – FIVE Jet Blue Airlines Pilots DEAD, Media Intentionally Hiding Vaxx Fears.” The post contained a link to Peters’ show. During that July 16 show, Peters and his guest Dr. Jane Ruby (who is not a medical doctor) claimed that five JetBlue pilots died as a result of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine shot. But oddly Ruby also admitted she didn’t know whether any of the pilots mentioned even received the shot. (We added bold text to the key portion of the quote below): Ruby then goes on to name five JetBlue employees who died between February and May of 2021. JetBlue has about 20,000 employees. In company marketing materials, JetBlue said it encouraged employees to get vaccinated and that the “majority” of crew members had received the vaccine. In obituaries found online for the JetBlue employees named by Ruby, two mentioned the cause of death. In those cases, the deaths had nothing to do with COVID-19 or the vaccine. One pilot died in a UTV accident. Another died of cancer. In a statement emailed to Snopes, JetBlue acknowledged that four pilots died in 2021. One employee named by Ruby wasn’t a pilot, but an inflight crew member. The company called the video an effort to intentionally mislead the public: The claim that five JetBlue “pilots” died from the vaccine echoes a similar claim about British Airways. That claim was also false and used the same method of apparently trawling the internet for people from the same airline company who died in prior months, then claiming without evidence they died from the vaccine. Peters and Ruby had previously taken to the show to claim that the vaccines were injected magnets into people, a claim that spectacularly backfired in an attempted live demonstration that went viral:  We are rating this claim “False” because it comes from an unreliable source with a track record for spreading misinformation, and by the source’s own admission, there is insufficient evidence to support the claim. We also note that the evidence that is available — namely the cause of death in two of the five cases — directly contradicts the claim.","https://factcheck.afp.com/http%253A%252F%252Fdoc.afp.com%252F9E94UF-1,https://archive.is/Ec2Hu,https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/08/21/qanon-2020-election/,https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-jane-ruby-49971411/,https://www.jetblue.com/safety,https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/kinston/name/alan-herring-obituary?pid=198826353,https://www.pressherald.com/2021/04/04/obituarybenjamin-c-ingraham/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/british-airways-pilots-died-covid-vax/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/magnets-covid-vaccine/","No, 5 JetBlue Pilots Didn’t Die From the COVID-19 Vaccine","COVID-19, COVID-19 Vaccine",,,,,

It should also be noted that reports about Osteen owning a Ferarri 458 Italia have not been verified. In fact, some news outlets that initially published this claim, such as the Houston Chronicle, have since deleted their articles.  We have not been able to find any verified reporting that Osteen owns a $325,000 Ferrari. There don’t appear to be any photographs of Osteen driving this exotic sports car, and we have not been able to find any statements from Osteen in which he talks about an exotic collection.  This rumor appears to be little more than an assumption. Osteen does have a reported net worth in the tens of millions (more on that later) and a large house in Houston, Texas. It certainly seems possible that Osteen has purchased an exotic car (or two), but so far these reports are not verified.  As for the photographs above, one (the top right image in the above-displayed meme) was originally posted to an Exotic Cars Flickr page in 2010. A spokesperson for the Exotic Car Life Flickr account told us that the photograph was taken in Coral Gables, Florida down the street from the luxury car dealership The Collection. They told us that they saw the car, which they believed to be a customized order, at one other event and provided us with numerous photographs, none of which featured Osteen. The spokesperson said: “I saw the car on another occasion at an event, no Joel Osteen was seen.”  It should also be noted that this meme features photographs of two different Ferraris. As noted above, one pic shows a custom Ferrari in 2010 in Florida. The other photograph shows a Ferrari in Zurich, Switzerland in 2013. The following video appears to be the source of the second photo:  In addition to this video’s being taken in Switzerland, not Houston, Texas, where Osteen resides, the driver can be seen toward the end of this video, and it is not Osteen.  It’s worth nothing that in 2018, an associate pastor at Osteen’s Lakewood Church was criticized for buying his wife a $200,000 Ferrari.  As these pictures went viral, a number of other claims about Osteen’s net worth were circulated on social media. One viral tweet, for example, claimed that Osteen had a net worth of more than $40 million, that he lived in a $10.5 million mansion, and that his Lakewood Church received $4.4 million in PPP Covid-19-relief loans. These claims, in general, are true. However, there’s a little nuance that should be noted.  Osteen does own a home in Houston that is valued at around $10 million, and his Lakewood Church did receive a $4.4 million PPP loan. Claims about Osteen’s net worth, however, are just estimations. We found estimates for Osteen’s net worth ranging from $40 to $100 million, which indicates that these are little more than guessing. While we can’t determine Osteen’s exact net worth, it is safe to say that he’s wealthy. The bulk of Osteen’s fortune appears to come from book sales. In addition to being a megachurch pastor and a televangelist, Osteen is also a successful author. In 2006, The New York Times reported that Osteen’s 2004 book “Your Best Life Now” sold more than 3 million hardcover copies: Osteen talked about his wealth during an interview with PennLive in 2013:","https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/osteen-ferrari.jpg,http://web.archive.org/web/20210719155332/https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Houston-Joel-Osteen-Lakewood-Church-pastor-Ferrari-16324077.php,https://www.flickr.com/photos/exoticcarlife/5019421600/in/photostream/,.com/news/houston-texas/article/Houston-Joel-Osteen-Lakewood-Church-pastor-Ferrari-16324077.php,https://houston.culturemap.com/news/real-estate/07-04-10-after-move-to-river-oaks-joel-osteen-wants-to-sell-tanglewood-land-for-11-million/#slide=0,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/osteen-coronavirus-loan/,https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Lakewood-Church-pastor-Joel-Osteen-By-the-numbers-6418086.php,https://www.inquisitr.com/1282934/joel-osteen-denies-being-a-prosperity-minister/,https://www.nickiswift.com/208920/the-most-expensive-things-joel-osteen-owns/#:~:text=Unlike%20an%20ordinary%20pastor%2C%20Joel,according%20to%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth.,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/15/business/media/religious-broadcaster-gets-rich-contract-for-next-book.html,http://pennlive.com/midstate/2013/05/joel_osteen_harrisburg_pennsyl.html","Does Joel Osteen Own a $325,000 Ferrari?",,,,,,

The following video appears to be the source of the second photo:  In addition to this video’s being taken in Switzerland, not Houston, Texas, where Osteen resides, the driver can be seen toward the end of this video, and it is not Osteen.  It’s worth nothing that in 2018, an associate pastor at Osteen’s Lakewood Church was criticized for buying his wife a $200,000 Ferrari.  As these pictures went viral, a number of other claims about Osteen’s net worth were circulated on social media. One viral tweet, for example, claimed that Osteen had a net worth of more than $40 million, that he lived in a $10.5 million mansion, and that his Lakewood Church received $4.4 million in PPP Covid-19-relief loans. These claims, in general, are true. However, there’s a little nuance that should be noted.  Osteen does own a home in Houston that is valued at around $10 million, and his Lakewood Church did receive a $4.4 million PPP loan. Claims about Osteen’s net worth, however, are just estimations. We found estimates for Osteen’s net worth ranging from $40 to $100 million, which indicates that these are little more than guessing. While we can’t determine Osteen’s exact net worth, it is safe to say that he’s wealthy. The bulk of Osteen’s fortune appears to come from book sales. In addition to being a megachurch pastor and a televangelist, Osteen is also a successful author. In 2006, The New York Times reported that Osteen’s 2004 book “Your Best Life Now” sold more than 3 million hardcover copies: Osteen talked about his wealth during an interview with PennLive in 2013:","https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/osteen-ferrari.jpg,http://web.archive.org/web/20210719155332/https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Houston-Joel-Osteen-Lakewood-Church-pastor-Ferrari-16324077.php,https://www.flickr.com/photos/exoticcarlife/5019421600/in/photostream/,.com/news/houston-texas/article/Houston-Joel-Osteen-Lakewood-Church-pastor-Ferrari-16324077.php,https://houston.culturemap.com/news/real-estate/07-04-10-after-move-to-river-oaks-joel-osteen-wants-to-sell-tanglewood-land-for-11-million/#slide=0,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/osteen-coronavirus-loan/,https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Lakewood-Church-pastor-Joel-Osteen-By-the-numbers-6418086.php,https://www.inquisitr.com/1282934/joel-osteen-denies-being-a-prosperity-minister/,https://www.nickiswift.com/208920/the-most-expensive-things-joel-osteen-owns/#:~:text=Unlike%20an%20ordinary%20pastor%2C%20Joel,according%20to%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth.,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/15/business/media/religious-broadcaster-gets-rich-contract-for-next-book.html,http://pennlive.com/midstate/2013/05/joel_osteen_harrisburg_pennsyl.html","Does Joel Osteen Own a $325,000 Ferrari?",,,,,,
29,,,,False,David Emery,2017-11-14,,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/author/david-emery/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/edward-mordrake/,"A nineteenth-century British man named Edward Mordrake (also spelled ""Mordake"") was born with a rare medical condition in the form of a extra face on the back of his head.",2017-11-14,snopes,,"One of the more interesting historical nuggets to cross our transom in recent years is the claim that a certain English gentleman of the nineteenth century named Edward Mordrake (or “Edward Mordake,” according to older sources) was born with a bizarre medical condition so troubling that it drove him to suicide:   Albeit popularized in the 2000s via memes, songs, and TV shows, the Edward Mordrake story isn’t of recent origin, having aroused the morbid interests of Victorian readers more than a century ago in Gould and Pyle’s Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine, first published in 1896. This is how the authors of that hefty volume recounted it: Despite the credulous reception the story has frequently received, there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical. For one, the entire passage about Edward Mordrake was quoted from what the authors describe as “lay sources” (more about which later), which sets it apart from other entries (such as their account of the life of Joseph Merrick, the “Elephant Man”) drawn from actual medical case histories. For another, it is heavy on melodrama (e.g., “he was kept from his rest at night by the hateful whispers of his ‘devil twin,’ as he called it”), while giving only the slightest nod to science (apart from applying the now-antiquated medical classification “bicephalic monsters,” there is really no scientific verbiage at all). And although it purports to cite two attending physicians, “Manvers and Treadwell,” a critique of the entry in the 1906 edition of The Theosophical Review reported that the names appeared nowhere in the Dict. of National Biography (a Victorian-era Who’s Who). The origin of the black-and-white photograph purporting to show Edward Mordrake and his “devil twin” in profile (which has appeared in Internet postings since 2007) is unknown. Despite its “vintage” appearance, the image exhibits greater resolution and clarity than what is typically seen in photographic reproductions of the mid-to-late Victorian era (e.g., the 1889 photograph of Joseph Merrick published in the British Medical Journal). It appears, in fact, to be a retouched photo of a wax figure in the Panoptikum Wax Museum in Hamburg, Germany: A Case of Asymmetrical Conjoined Twins? There does exist a real medical condition, Craniopagus parasiticus, whose symptoms bear a very basic resemblance to those described in this case. It’s an extremely rare complication in conjoined twins wherein one of the pair is underdeveloped and less than fully functional (hence “parasitic”), and takes the form of a vestigial head attached to the cranium of the “autositic” (dominant) twin. According to a 2016 case report, there have only been ten or fewer recorded cases of Craniopagus parasiticus in history, “of which only three survived past birth and were documented in the literature.” Of those three, two died before the age of two, despite surgical attempts to save the life of the autositic twin. The third, known famously as the “two-headed boy of Bengal,” lived to be four years old and was reported to be in good health until he was bitten by a cobra and died. Most significantly, as regards the Edward Mordrake case, conjoined twins are by definition genetically identical, so they are always of the same sex. The “devil twin” described in that case was female, while the autositic twin was male (though it could be argued, of course, that the vestigial face was misidentified as female). That the “sneering” face had no audible voice comports with such information as we have on real cases of Craniopagus parasiticus, but the claims that it exhibited “every sign of intelligence” and taunted the poor man with “hateful whispers” do not. Accounts of the two-headed boy of Bengal said the vestigial face in that case could “grimace” and its eyes were observed moving, for example, but though there could have been some sort of rudimentary consciousness present there were no signs of intelligence. Alternatively, it has been suggested that Mordrake might have suffered instead from a congenital defect known as Diprosopus (or craniofacial duplication), in which facial features are duplicated to a greater or lesser extent on other areas of the head (in the rarest cases, the full face is duplicated). The mechanisms behind this deformity aren’t fully understood, although many researchers believe it to be another rare form of conjoined twinning. Although somewhat more common than Craniopagus parasiticus (with just under 50 instances documented since the mid-nineteenth century), Diprosopus has a similarly poor survival rate, with most cases ending in stillbirth. In short, although science does offer theoretical explanations for Mordrake’s condition, they are few and only marginally plausible. About Those “Lay Sources” Gould and Pyle reported in 1896 that the “well-known story of Edward Mordake” they quoted was taken from “lay sources” — plural — despite the fact that there was really only one. Science historian Alex Boese has traced the quoted text, verbatim, to a syndicated newspaper article written in 1895 by Charles Lotin Hildreth, a poet and author of speculative fiction: What all these “wonders of science” had in common, Boese points out, is that no mention of them is to be found in any previous sources. None. It appears, in other words, that Hildreth simply made them up. Albeit couched as nonfiction, the article was actually a work of speculative fiction in the spirit of other scientific hoaxes of the time, such as the infamous life-on-the-moon hoax of 1835 and the Cardiff Giant hoax of 1869. Boese concludes — convincingly, we find — that Edward Mordrake was the literary creation of Charles Lotin Hildreth. He never really existed.","https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/11/edward-mordrake.jpg,https://www.memecenter.com/fun/2008989/edward-mordrake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGci5Tlur9o,http://americanhorrorstory.wikia.com/wiki/Edward_Mordrake,https://books.google.com/books?id=4k1rAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA188#v=onepage&q&f=false,https://books.google.com/books?id=4k1rAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA189#v=onepage&q&f=false,https://books.google.com/books?id=sowkAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA363#v=onepage&q&f=false,https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Josephmerrick1889.jpg,https://youtu.be/2yIeG4Ldp4M?t=66,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5134060/,https://web.archive.org/web/20080327214927/www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/148/the_twoheaded_boy_of_bengal.html,http://hoaxes.org/weblog/comments/edward_mordake,https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/moon-shot-race-a-hoax-and-the-birth-of-fake-news,https://www.livescience.com/55787-cardiff-giant.html","Edward Mordrake, the Man with Two Faces",medical anomalies,,,,,

These images are frequently accompanied by a piece of text about honey mushrooms, such as this paragraph that went viral when it was posted to Facebook in May 2021: “Giant mushroom, Oregon ……… Armillaria ostoyae, commonly known as the honey mushroom, is bigger than most animals, and is considered the largest and oldest organism on Earth. The mushroom covers 3,726563 m 2 of Malheur National Forest, Oregon, and is estimated to be around 8,650 years old.” While Armillaria ostoyae is a real mushroom and is considered to be one of the largest and oldest organisms on earth, it is not pictured in these images. The above-displayed images are the result of photo manipulation.  The “largest mushroom in the world” may conjure up images similar to the giant individual mushrooms shown in these viral photographs. However, Armillaria ostoyae‘s impressive growth takes place across (and under) the ground, not up into the air. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) writes that this “humongous fungus” is spread out across thousands of acres of the Malheur National Forest. Since this is a single organism, it is considered to be the largest mushroom in the world, but photographs of this humongous fungus are not quite as impressive as the fake photos shown above. Here’s a genuine picture of Armillaria ostoyae from the USDA:  The BBC explained: As for these digitally edited works of fantastical fungus, we’ve been able to track down the source of one of them. The image showing a group of people staring up at a humongous fungus was created circa 2000 by a fungal biology student at the University of California, Berkeley. This image was created as a joke by Dirk Redecker, who is now a microbiologist and curator for the International Bank for the Glomales (an order of symbiotic fungi) at the French National Institute for Agricultural Research. We reached out to Redecker for comment and will update this article if more information becomes available.  When Waffles at Noon reached out to Tom Bruns, Professor Emeritus of Fungal Ecology at Berkeley, for more information about this photo, he identified the mushroom as “Boletus photoshopus” and noted that it was pictured in its natural habitat, the digital photo. Bruns elaborated on the origins of this image in an email to Snopes. Bruns told us that this fake image was made circa 2000 as a “fun lab portrait.” Bruns and his then-student Redecker used an image of a Boletus rex-veris, a mushroom that stands about 8 inches tall, to create the giant mushroom pictured in this image. Bruns said: We have not been able to source the second image. However, we can say with absolute certainty that it is not a genuine photo of a fantastically large fungus. In fact, the Malheur National Forest has commented on this fake photo, writing: “Every few months a new crazy giant mushroom image shows up on social media referring to the Humongous Fungus on the Malheur National Forest. While it is true the fungus is the largest living organism it looks nothing like this.”","https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/giant-mushrooms.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10220626239988363&set=a.3959974040203,https://web.archive.org/web/20190803005438/https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsbdev3_033146.pdf,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/worlds-largest-mushroom.jpg,http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141114-the-biggest-organism-in-the-world,http://science.redeckeria.org/monsterbolete1b.jpg,http://wafflesatnoon.com/debunking-the-worlds-largest-mushroom-photo/",The World’s Largest Mushroom Looks Nothing Like These Viral Images,,,,,,

The ads appeared to promise a handy bathroom trick. For example, this ad appeared next to an article on the New York Post website. The ad read: “[Pics] Always Place a Toilet Paper Roll Under the Toilet Seat at Night, Here’s Why.” It was sponsored by the Maternity Week website. Clicking on the ad led to a 41-page slideshow article and a headline that read: “These 40 Brilliant Tricks Will Make Even The Hardest Items To Clean Sparkle.” The story’s first page read as follows: On that first page, the story once again teased some grand trick with a cardboard toilet paper roll, perhaps involving a toilet seat and nighttime. The web address (URL) even mentioned the toilet paper trick for what is known as UTM tracking. This meant that the website’s creator was tracking whether the ad was successfully getting clicks and bringing in readers. After all, someone was apparently paying to run the ads on the Outbrain advertising network, so it’s typically important to figure out if they’re worth the investment. The article contained several odd household tricks. One claimed it would be good to put hairbrushes in the dishwasher. Another advised about pouring various liquids down the drain, which we covered in two previous fact checks about dish soap and salt. We also found a questionable oven cleaning tip, plus purported bread uses, which we also covered in the past. On page 41, which was the last page, a toilet paper roll trick was finally revealed. However, it had nothing to do with placing it under a toilet seat at night. It simply advised to attach a cardboard roll to a vacuum cleaner hose to reach crevices. The 41-page article never mentioned a word about why to always place a toilet paper roll under a toilet seat at night. It was nothing but clickbait. We clicked “next page” 40 times so you don’t have to. We looked to home improvement websites such as BobVila.com to see if there was perhaps a legitimate purpose for the toilet paper roll going under the seat. However, we found no such tips, tricks, or “life hacks.” We’ve clicked through thousands of pages in these kinds of strange slideshow articles that come from scammy ads.

The video, which was produced by 60 Second Docs and translated from Portuguese to English via subtitles, included this narration by the artist, Duda Lozano:  As you can see, the video included multiple instances in which hands rubbed or touched the tattoos to seemingly prove that they were flat on someone’s skin instead of textured like actual embroidered patches. To investigate further, we studied the artist’s Instagram and Facebook pages, where he posted numerous images and videos of the “embroidery tattoos” over the course of months. One video in which he was tagged presumably showed his work being stretched out across someone’s skin as it was rubbed, proving the tattoos lacked depth that would make them 3-dimensional. Another clip apparently showed him in the process of giving an “embroidery tattoo” using a standard tattoo machine and other tools to make the permanent body modification. Snopes also found profiles by INKED, a magazine that highlights trends in the industry, and My Modern Met that highlighted Lozano’s pieces — evidence that, again, confirmed the realness and credibility of his art. The latter publication — which aims to promote “visually stunning images” across a variety of platforms, such as photography and science, according to its bio — stated: We reached out to Lozano to learn more about how he created the optical illusions. We will update this page if we hear back. Nonetheless, we found no evidence of any digital manipulation or Lozano using practices that would not apply to other types of tattooing, such as neo-realism or traditional line work. (In fact, based on his social media pages, he was also capable of those styles.) For those reasons, and considering the evidence outlined above, it is “True” that the so-called “embroidery tattoos” are authentic body modifications that look like 3-dimensional stitched patches but are actually flat on people’s skin, like all other tattoos.
