This was formalized into law by the country's parliament on July 25, 2021, despite widespread protests against it.However, the Republican Guard did not resign in relation to this law, and is not tasked with the French president's immediate physical safety.The unit responsible for direct personal protection of the French head of state is the Groupe de sécurité de la présidence de la République, whose members hail from both the police and the Gendarmerie.The Republican Guard is a French army unit tasked with ""public safety missions and protocol representation,"" according to its official webpage. Its members are not in charge of the direct safety of the French president like the US Secret Service, but they indirectly play this role by ensuring the security of the Elysee Palace, where the president lives. A spokesperson for the Gendarmerie told AFP on July 26, 2021 that the Republican Guard ""is still"" performing its palace duties. The Gendarmerie is a branch of the French army tasked with law enforcement roles, to which the Republican Guard answers.

The claim is false: the World Health Organization and the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) in South Africa told AFP Fact Check that Covid-19 vaccines do not contain cells from aborted foetuses or other human tissue.The three-minute clip has been shared more than 330 times since it was posted on Facebook on July 17, 2021.Besides including the claim that mRNA Covid-19 vaccines contain aborted human foetal matter, the video makes two other unsubstantiated claims: that the vaccines can alter a person’s DNA and that they can render people sterile. Screenshot of the false post, taken on July 20, 2021The clip, which was extracted from a longer video originally posted here on YouTube on February 5, 2021, features preacher Joshua Maponga interviewing guest Mike Southwood in a show dubbed “why Africans should not take vaccine (sic)”.The Zimbabwe-born Maponga lives in South Africa and is an author of several books and has a large following on social media. He also runs Galaxy Universal Network, a media production company in South Africa.Southwood — who makes the false and unsubstantiated claims during his interview — is the founder of the Unity Group in South Africa, which styles itself as a governance reform movement. According to media, Southwood is also the administrator of the #EndTheLockdownMzanzi group, which has been urging South Africans to defy Covid-19 lockdown laws. A shorter version of the clip was published here on Facebook in South Africa on July 15, 2021, and shared more than 600 times.How mRNA vaccines workPfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines are made from messenger RNA. The two vaccines work by giving a “blueprint” of a part of the virus that the body can then recognise and fight when confronted by it later.The vaccines use tiny fat bubbles called lipid nanoparticles to encapsulate fragile mRNA molecules and the information they contain to protect them until they can be safely delivered into cells without being degraded by the body’s enzymes.  However, the claim made in the clip that the vaccines include aborted foetus cells is false. No material from aborted foetusesProfessor Penny Moore, from South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), told AFP Fact Check that Covid-19 vaccines do not contain cells from aborted foetuses or any other human material.“They are produced through high-tech molecular biology approaches and in cultures in rigorously controlled laboratories,” said Moore.The World Health Organization (WHO) told AFP Fact Check that “the new mRNA vaccines, such as those developed by Pfizer and Moderna, are synthetic vaccines and do not use foetal cell lines in their production.”What are cell lines?According to the WHO, vaccines are made by growing cultures of the target virus or bacterium: “Viruses need to grow in cells and so vaccine viruses are often grown in eggs (such as the influenza vaccine) or in cell lines derived from mammals, including humans.”The cell lines that are used to grow the viruses originate from a primary culture of cells from an organ of a single animal that has been propagated repeatedly in a laboratory, often over many decades.AFP Fact Check has previously debunked social media posts claiming that Covid-19 vaccines contain MRC-5, which the posts claim are “aborted foetal cells and other DNA”.The best known human cell line is MRC-5, or Medical Research Council cell strain 5, which are cells used to grow viruses for vaccines against rubella, chickenpox and hepatitis A in laboratories. MRC-5 was originally derived from the lung tissue of an aborted foetus in the 1960s but has since been grown without recourse to foetal tissue.The History of Vaccines, an educational tool developed by the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, states that “in total, only two foetuses, both obtained from abortions done by maternal choice, have given rise to the human cell strains used in vaccine development”.The Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine — which is not an mRNA but a viral vector vaccine — used a human cell line developed from the retinal cells of a foetus aborted in 1985 in its early production stage. But, the WHO said, “no foetal material is present” in the final J&J Covid-19 vaccine product or any other vaccine that uses human cell lines in early production stages.A spokesperson for the Oxford Vaccine Group, an organisation that was involved in producing the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, told AFP Fact Check that during its development, they used HEK-293 cells.The HEK-293 cell line was originally cultivated from a foetus aborted in the Netherlands in the early 1970s. The NICD’s Moore added that human cell lines were used only in the early stages of the production of some vaccines. “For all vaccines that use cell lines during early production stages, all cells are removed during the purification process and the final vaccine product does not contain this material.”The WHO told AFP Fact Check that it is not aware of any vaccines currently being developed for Covid-19 that contain cell lines obtained from foetal tissue. mRNA Covid-19 vaccines do not alter people’s DNA The unsubstantiated claim that mRNA vaccines can modify human DNA has been widely rejected by scientists. AFP Fact Check has previously debunked the claim here and here.Matthew Miller, an associate professor with the Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Science at McMaster University in Canada, was quoted in a previous AFP Fact Check from March 2021 as saying that “mRNA is the code for proteins. It does not alter the DNA of your cells. Indeed, your cells naturally make mRNA from DNA.”Barry Pakes, an assistant professor at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto, told AFP Fact Check in April 2021 that “the mRNA cannot be integrated into the human genome. We (humans) lack the enzymes to reverse transcribe mRNA to DNA”.The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also refutes the claim that Covid-19 vaccines can alter people’s DNA.“Covid-19 vaccines do not change or interact with your DNA in any way. Both mRNA and viral vector CovidD-19 vaccines deliver instructions (genetic material) to our cells to start building protection against the virus that causes Covid-19. However, the material never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where our DNA is kept,” the organisation states on its website.Vaccines do not cause infertilityIn the video, Southwood claims that Covid-19 vaccines can cause infertility. “We believe that there are a lot of things in this vaccine that will render people sterile…”The CDC states on its website that “there is currently no evidence that any vaccines, including Covid-19 vaccines, cause fertility problems (problems trying to get pregnant)”.Kate White, an obstetrics and gynaecology professor at Boston School of Medicine, told AFP Fact Check in March 2021 that “there’s no vaccine in the world that can cause infertility”.Dasantila Golemi-Kotra, a microbiologist at York University, told AFP that “vaccine-induced antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are unlikely to cross-react with the syncytin-1 or -2 in the body and lead to infertility”.Golemi-Kotra explained that the misinformation could be stemming from the fact that the anti-spike protein antibodies and the syncytin-1 protein of the placenta share a “very short amino acid region”.But this doesn’t mean that the immune system would attack the syncytin protein. The immune system can “recognise a surface in their target protein, which rarely is confined to a single short amino acid sequence,” she said.AFP Fact Check has debunked numerous claims about Covid-19 vaccines, available here.",,mRNA Covid-19 vaccines do not contain cells from aborted human foetuses,,,,,,

Screenshot taken on July 22, 2021 of a video from the Stew Peters Show shared on RumbleRuby claims that she read an English translation of the Spanish research that shows the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine is dangerous because it contains graphene oxide.Graphene oxide is a derivative of graphene, which has been reported to have antibacterial and antiviral properties. Graphene is super strong, ultra thin and has potential applications in a range of industries.""It's virtually 99.99 percent graphene oxide,"" Ruby says of the shot, while also claiming the substance is a ""poison"" and that it ""destroys literally everything in the cell.""Clips from the segment can also be found on Facebook, Instagram, and the video-sharing platform BitChute.It is part of a torrent of inaccurate claims about vaccines that have proliferated across the internet as countries around the world seek to immunize their populations against Covid-19.The same claim was amplified by GlobalResearch.ca, a Canadian website that the US State Department has described as ""deeply enmeshed in Russia's broader disinformation and propaganda ecosystem."" But the ingredients of all the Covid-19 vaccines authorized for use in the US and Canada (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca) are publicly listed and do not include graphene oxide.Pfizer spokeswomanDervila Keane confirmed to AFP on July 8, 2021 that ""graphene oxide is not used in the manufacture of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.""Spanish studyIn the video, Ruby is referencing a Spanish study published by Dr Pablo Campra at the end of June. The study was not published in a scientific journal, and has not been subjected to peer review.In it, Campra says that Ricardo Delgado requested the study. Delgado is the founder of La Quinta Columna (Fifth Column), a group that has spread misleading information about masks and PCR tests. Their claims about graphene in Covid-19 shots -- including that it generates electromagnetic properties in humans -- were debunked by AFP Factual in early June.To conduct the study, Campra examined a single sample of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine using optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). He then compared the images with those in other scientific literature.He said he found ""solid evidence of the probable presence of graphene derivatives"". Ester Vazquez, an expert in graphene health and safety who works with the European Commission's Graphene Flagship research group, told AFP on July 13 that she had read the study and found it ""rather inconclusive.""She said that microscopy is not an adequate method to study the presence of graphene or graphene oxide.""The tests carried out are insufficient to characterize graphene. It only shows some microscopy images that resemble pictures of graphene and graphene oxide in the literature. However, this is far from scientific proof -- graphene identification would require further analysis using other techniques,"" Vazquez said.Contacted by AFP about the study, Campra said on July 14: ""Our finding is that 99 percent of UV absorbance does not come from RNA, and its signal is compatible with graphene. But, many other substances show the same signal. We found microscopic evidence of graphene sheets, but further spectroscopic evidence is needed to confirm this structure.""Campra, who teaches at the University of Almeria, said that the results and conclusions of his report ""do not imply any institutional position"" of the school.The university issued a statement on July 2 on Twitter distancing itself from the study -- which it called ""unofficial"" -- saying it used methodology that lacked transparency.The methodology of the study was also questioned in a fact check by Health Feedback, a network of scientists, which concluded that Campra did not adhere to ""traceability"" protocols. This leaves the origin of his sample unclear, and makes it impossible to know if it was contaminated during the investigation process.Graphene in vaccinesProfessor Hong Byung-hee, an expert in nanomaterials at Seoul National University, told AFP for another fact-check on July 19 that ""graphene is being tested for biomedical purposes, including for vaccines, but these applications are still in an experimental phase and a long wait is expected before they become commercially available following clinical trials.""Graphene oxide is being studied in vaccines as a possible adjuvant, or ingredient to help the shot trigger stronger immune response. It was recently used as an adjuvant in the investigation of an intranasal vaccine against influenza, developed by the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State University, in the United States. This vaccine has only been tested in mice and cell culture.Dr Park Jong-bo, a researcher at Biographene, a company that develops graphene-based medicine, also confirmed on July 20 that ""no vaccines on the market (are) based on graphene oxide.""Vaccines currently in use are ""comprised of phospholipid layers, peptides or nucleic acids, and graphene oxide is not part of these categories,"" Park said.AFP Fact Check has debunked a series of inaccurate claims about vaccines, available in English here.",,Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine does not contain dangerous ingredient,,,,,,

This is false; the state has released voluntary energy saving tips that include charging vehicles before an electricity conservation alert is issued, and a spokeswoman for the grid operator denied people were forbidden from charging.“CALIFORNIA literally just told everyone to not charge their electric cars Due to power shortage,” a June 18, 2021 Facebook post read during a heat wave which sent temperatures soaring past 100 degrees Fahrenheit on some days, posing threats of energy shortages.  A screenshot of a Facebook post taken on June 22, 2021“So much for those green energy vehicles. California is asking us to conserve energy and strain on our power grid. No charging electric cars,” a social media user commented in a June 18 tweet. Other examples of the post can also be found on Twitter here, as well as Instagram and Facebook, here and here. “There is no truth in that statement,” Lindsay Buckley, director of communications and external affairs at the California Energy Commission, the state’s energy policy agency, said of the claim.Much of the western United States suffered a record heat wave in June, with approximately 50 million Americans placed on alert on June 15 for ""excessive"" temperatures, approaching 120 degrees Fahrenheit in some areas.As a result, the state’s non-profit power grid manager, California Independent System Operator (ISO), issued  several “Flex Alerts” to help keep the power grid stable. These called on residents to voluntarily conserve energy at selected times including during peak hours of consumption. Alerts were sent state-wide on June 17 and June 18, coinciding with when the social media claims about the electric vehicles started spreading. Anne Gonzales, senior public information officer at ISO, told AFP that they “have encouraged consumers to charge EVs (electric vehicles) before a Flex Alert begins. We do not say anything about ‘not charging’ in our messaging.”On June 17, California ISO also posted advice on what to do before and during a Flex Alert. The organization recommended charging battery powered cars prior to its start.  A screenshot of the Flex Alert website’s tips to help conserve energy in CaliforniaThe website dedicated to these energy saving tips recommends that people avoid charging electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles during an alert, and to charge them overnight instead. Buckley, of the Energy Commission, confirmed to AFP that Flex Alerts “are fully voluntary, and the program's messaging emphasizes shifting energy consumption -- not sacrificing.”Gil Tal, director of the Plug-in Hybrid & Electric Vehicle Research Center of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis, told AFP that “Flex Alerts ask the public not to charge electric vehicles during the alert, which is usually 6:00 pm-9:00 pm or 5:00 pm-10:00 pm at the most.”Most drivers don’t replenish their vehicle batteries during those times anyway, Tal said.Electric vehicle drivers “usually charge at home and can use a timer to start charging after midnight or at work during the day. Very few actually charge during those (peak) hours and even fewer need to charge at that time,” he explained.He added that electric cars’ improved battery life generally only requires a charge every few days. As Californians rely heavily on motor vehicles, the transport sector accounts for about half of the state's greenhouse gas emissions.In September 2020, the office of Governor Gavin Newsom ordered that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state by 2035 should be zero-emission under a new rule aimed at fighting climate change and smog-fouled air.",,Californians can charge electric vehicles despite heat waves,,,,,,

Instead of confronting the immune system with part of a virus in a weakened or deactivated form to build antibodies, they give it a ""blueprint"" of a part of the virus that the body can then recognize and fight when confronted by it later.They use tiny fat bubbles called lipid nanoparticles to encapsulate fragile mRNA molecules and the information they contain to protect them until they can be safely delivered into cells without being degraded by the body's enzymes.

But medical experts say vaccines do not cause babies to suddenly die, and that evidence indicates there are lower rates of SIDS in children who receive the recommended shots.Medical understanding of SIDS -- a sudden death of a seemingly healthy infant, generally during sleep -- remains incomplete. But the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia say studies show that vaccines do not cause the rare syndrome.Below, AFP Fact Check examines various claims about SIDS and vaccines.‘VIDS’“SIDS has always been VIDS,” says a June 14, 2021 Facebook post with a screenshot of a tweet, abbreviating “Vaccine Infant Death Syndrome.” “Everyone knows a family who lost a perfectly healthy baby to SIDS- a mysterious infant death for no medical reason. Now look around you. How many perfectly healthy adults are dying shortly after their vaccine shot. 2+2=?” says the June 13 tweet, in an implied comparison between SIDS deaths and purported fatalities linked to Covid-19 shots.AFP has debunked numerous false or misleading claims linking the Covid-19 inoculations to deaths. Screenshot of a tweet taken on June 30, 2021But childhood vaccines and Covid-19 shots are not comparable. In the US, the vaccine schedule between the ages of two and four months -- when an infant is most at risk for SIDS -- prevents diseases including hepatitis B, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio.By contrast, Covid-19 shots protect against the illness caused by the novel coronavirus and are not currently recommended for children under 12 years old. Mayo Clinic, Children's National and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) say that immunizing babies may be associated with lower risk of SIDS.Dr Rachel Moon, who chairs the AAP Task Force on SIDS, said that while there is overlap in the period of high risk for SIDS and frequent vaccinations for babies, “multiple studies have looked at this relationship and found that there is no causal relationship, meaning that it’s a coincidence in timing.”“There is no increased risk of SIDS when you get the vaccines. And actually, the studies suggest that babies who are vaccinated are at lower risk of SIDS. That may be because if you’ve been recently ill, you’re more likely to die from SIDS. Vaccinated babies are less likely to get ill, for multiple reasons,” she added.Dr Robert Jacobson, a pediatrician at Mayo Clinic, agreed. “If anything, we see lower rates of Sudden Infant Death among infants vaccinated than in infants who have foregone the vaccinations,” he said.While this reduction may not be directly due to vaccination, ""there’s no data that has shown any one of the vaccines actually increases your risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome,” he said.Link to coronavirus restrictions?Social media posts that circulated in 2020 claimed that the decline in immunizations brought on by measures aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19 led to a decrease in SIDS cases. ""One of the many lessons from the pandemic: fewer pediatrician vaccine visits… and a massive decline in children inexplicably dying in their sleep. (SIDS/SUIDS). Related? Yes. Stop pretending otherwise,” said a screenshot of a tweet in a July 20, 2020 Facebook post. Screenshot of part of a Facebook post, taken on July 2, 2021A Twitter spokesperson said that the account that shared the message is now suspended from Twitter for “coordinated harmful activity,” which can include spreading medical misinformation.The head of the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Robert Anderson, said that data does not show evidence of a “massive” decline in SIDS or infant mortality in general for the first half of 2020.In fact, the yearly number of infant deaths attributed to SIDS ending in the second half of 2019 is equal to the amount during the first half of 2020 -- less than 34 per 100,000 live births.   Screenshot of SIDS death data on the National Center for Health Statistics website, taken on July 1, 2021 Anderson noted that the 2020 data may be “slightly underestimated” because “deaths ultimately attributed to SIDS (or similar terminology) tend to be delayed as they typically require a lengthy investigation.”Faulty ‘evidence’False claims of a link between childhood vaccines and SIDS long predate Covid-19. Some social media posts cite a study by Dr William Torch to back the claim that vaccines cause SIDS, but the 1982 study was challenged by researchers, and Torch himself admitted it was difficult to draw definite conclusions from his work. Screenshot of part of a Facebook post, taken on July 2, 2021A significant decline in US cases in the 1990s is attributed to the implementation of the “Back-to-Sleep” program, which instructs parents on how to safely put their babies to bed.Placing infants on their back on a firm surface with no other items, such as toys or blankets, in a room shared with a parent are all ways to reduce risk of SIDS.SIDS in JapanOther posts laud Japan for halting vaccinations for children under two in 1994, claiming that the country then experienced a 96 percent drop in infant mortality rate. Screenshot of a Facebook post taken on July 1, 2021While it is true that children in Japan are particularly healthy by international standards, they are also one of the most vaccinated populations in the world.The Japanese schedule for vaccines is similar to that of the US, with multiple shots recommended for babies between two and four months.Japanese law was indeed amended in 1994 to make vaccination more of a civic duty than a strict legal obligation, but in practice, schools ask for children’s vaccination history as they apply.The law on vaccines stipulates that all citizens “must endeavour to undergo a routine vaccination” against “category A diseases,” such as measles, mumps, rubeola, and tetanus. Although there are no fines for not vaccinating children, inoculation rates are very high and frequently reach 100 percent of the population for certain diseases, according to the Japanese Health Ministry.Data showed that SIDS rates in Japan actually took an upturn around 1995 following the law change, but declined in subsequent years.",,Vaccination does not cause babies to die in their sleep,,,,,,

But the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) says its surveillance measures guard against metallic contamination, while experts add that prions could not be responsible, and nanoparticles are not being added to meat.“Don’t go to the store without your magnet,” says a June 14, 2021 Facebook post. Screenshot of a Facebook post taken June 16, 2021In the video, a man sticks a small round magnet onto the outside of a package of chicken. He says: “They’re just putting little prions in here,” suggesting that the prions -- an infectious protein -- are causing magnetic effects.Multiple posts making similar claims about a variety of packaged and unpackaged poultry and meat products can also be found on Instagram, where the most popular iteration has topped 40,000 views. Videos on YouTube and Tik Tok, as well as compilation videos, have further spread the claim.It comes after a series of false and misleading claims that linked Covid-19 vaccinations to magnetism spread around the world. These included a hoax, supposedly shown in videos, that people’s arms exhibit magnetic properties after they receive the shots.Other posts claim a variety of reasons as to why magnets may stick to the meat. One says, “they are putting magnetic nano partials (sic) in our meat,” while another claims “they put heavy toxic metals in our food supply.” Mick West, a British-American science writer, published a video on Metabunk.org, a website dedicated to debunking pseudoscience, demonstrating that magnets, coins, or other smooth objects will stick to various body parts, if one’s skin is slightly oily. “Remove the oil and the object will not stick,” he explains.For similar reasons, magnets might stick to meat and poultry “due to the texture, angle or moisture of the product,” the USDA told AFP.“However, this does not mean that there is metal in the meat or poultry. All meat and poultry products bearing the USDA mark of inspection have been inspected for safety, wholesomeness, and accurate labeling,” a USDA spokesperson said on June 21, 2021.The spokesperson added that all establishments inspected by USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service are required to have a system in place “designed to prevent, eliminate, or reduce to acceptable levels any biological, chemical, or physical hazard that is reasonably likely to occur in the product.”As a result, it is unlikely that an undetected piece of metal could contaminate meat products, the spokesperson said, with many establishments going so far as to “install metal detectors and/or X-ray devices for screening their final products to ensure no accidental/unexpected metal (shaving or a broken piece) is present”.FSIS personnel also conduct regular inspections.As for the social media claim that prions may be a magnetic component found in meat, “this suggested hypothesis has no foundation in science,” the USDA spokesperson said, adding: “They are organic matter. More specifically, they are misfolded proteins. Therefore, they would lack any sort of magnetic quality.”Prions have an association with meat through the most well-known prion disease, BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) -- also called mad cow disease -- which affects cattle and is believed to be related to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in humans. Dr James Mastrianni, a professor of neurology at University of Chicago Medicine, told AFP on June 17, 2021: “There is some association of prions in meat, but these came from diseased cows being inadvertently used in the preparation of bovine-derived food. They were never purposely injected into meat, although how could anyone disprove such a crazy hypothesis?“Even if they were injected into meat, they are not magnetic and could certainly not perform the magic act of making a magnet stick to it.”Some of the claims suggest that the phenomenon is caused by nanoparticles -- tiny materials invisible to the eye which can be of various types. Iron is a natural component of beef and other meats but Jaydee Hanson, policy director at the Center for Food Safety, an activist group, told AFP on June 21, 2021: “While there is a remote chance that a powerful magnet could pick up on the magnetism of the iron in meat, it is really unlikely that most refrigerator magnets are that sensitive.“As far as I know, no nano ingredients are being added to meats in the US.”",,"Misleading claims about magnetism spread to meat, poultry",,,,,,

Zuckerberg joined the platform in 2009 under the handle @finkd, not “@Markzuckerberg” as seen in the hoax screenshot. Since creating his account, the Facebook founder has tweeted only 19 times, with his last tweet dating back to January 2012. A screenshot taken on June 9, 2021, showing Zuckerberg's Twitter account and last tweetThough unverified, the account is followed by Google CEO Sundar Pichai, YouTube, Microsoft and Zuckerberg’s Facebook. @finkd is followed by Google CEO, YouTube, Microsoft and Facebook itselfIn 2009, Zuckerberg was reported to have maintained a private account with the handle @zuck which sent no public tweet until it was deactivated. He rejoined Twitter in March 2009 with his current handle, although the account is dormant today. Business Insider reported that Zuckerberg followed only one person in 2019. Zuckerberg used these accounts around the time he was looking to buy Twitter but the deal failed.None of Zuckerberg’s 19 tweets mention Nigeria or Buhari, who was elected in 2015, three years after Zuckerberg last tweeted. There is also no evidence that Zuckerberg has tweeted at all in 2021.According to the fabricated screenshot, the tweet has been retweeted 2.6 million times and liked 3.7 million times. If this was the case, it would be one of the most shared tweets in Twitter history. Wikipedia keeps a list of the most retweeted tweets in history and according to the list, the tweet does not exist.Tweets are easily fabricatedIt is difficult to prove a tweet once existed after it has been deleted unless it was archived on websites like Wayback Machine. The New York Times created a database of all tweets posted by former US president Donald Trump, while Factbase saved all his deleted tweets here. Tweets can also easily be doctored.

The claims are false: AFP has previously debunked all purported reasons cited in the misleading posts, including claims that coronavirus vaccines have not been tested on animals or that their ingredients have not been published by pharmaceutical companies.The claim was shared here on South Korean blogging platform Naver Blog on May 29, 2021.The Korean-language post reads: “I met with a prominent professor of biotechnology. He’s currently working at a university in Boston, USA. We talked about the current Covid-19 situation.“Since he is afraid of being called a conspiracy theorist, he didn’t want to identify himself. But I’m sharing what I heard because it might be helpful to you.” Screenshot of the misleading Naver Blog post, taken on June 4, 2021.The post lists “eight reasons not to get vaccinated”:1) mRNA technology lacks a track record of studies;2) There is no scientific evidence that Covid-19 vaccines can protect people;3) The virus’s spike protein sheds and reproduces itself;4) The body will become a factory to produce spike protein;5) Covid-19 vaccines were not tested on animals;6) Vaccine makers did not reveal the ingredients of their products;7) Doctors are afraid of reporting adverse events in case of retaliation from drug companies; and8) PCR tests are not scientifically reliable.The same list has been shared on Facebook here and here; on Naver Blog here and here; and on Daum Blog here.The claim surfaced as South Korea raced to beef up its coronavirus vaccine roll-out, with authorities pledging to inoculate 13 million people with their first dose by the end of June.While South Korea was held up as a model in handling the pandemic, the government has faced criticism for an initially sluggish vaccination campaign compared with other developed countries.However, the claims are false. AFP has previously debunked all purported reasons cited in the misleading posts.mRNA technologyMessenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, like the ones developed by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, deliver genetic instructions to produce the viral proteins needed to provoke a safe but robust offensive against the coronavirus.While no mRNA vaccine had ever been approved for humans before the pandemic, the technology has been in the making for years.“mRNA vaccines have been studied before for flu, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV),” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on its website on March 4, 2021.“As soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes COVID-19 was available, scientists began designing the mRNA instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mRNA vaccine.”The CDC said mRNA vaccines have been held to the same standards as all other types of vaccines in the United States.Covid-19 vaccine efficacyInternational health experts recommend taking the vaccine to build immunity against SARS-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. “Studies show that COVID-19 vaccines are effective at keeping you from getting COVID-19. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine will also help keep you from getting seriously ill even if you do get COVID-19,” the World Health Organization (WHO) said on October 28, 2020.Scientists are still learning how well vaccines prevent the transmission of the virus, although “early data show that vaccines help keep people with no symptoms from spreading COVID-19,” the CDC said.Spike proteinsHealth experts said there is no shedding of the virus’s spike protein -- which the vaccine makes inside the body to elicit an immune response -- when people receive a Covid-19 jab.Dasantila Golemi-Kotra, a microbiologist at Canada’s York University said that “no spike protein gets shed when we get vaccinated.”“Even if the spike protein was shedding, although impossible, this protein cannot infect someone else,” she told AFP in April 2021. Barry Pakes, assistant professor at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto, also explained in April 2021 that “there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever of shedding of spike protein in vaccinated individuals, nor is it even theoretically possible.”Scientists said that mRNA from vaccines was quickly degraded in the body.“There is no doubt that after a very short period of time, after it has created antigens [proteins] which in turn lead to antibodies, the RNA from the vaccine is destroyed,” French geneticist Axel Kahn told AFP in December 2020.Animal testsIn the US, three Covid-19 vaccines have been authorised for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA): one from Pfizer-BioNtech, another from Moderna and a third from Johnson & Johnson.All three companies disclosed the results of trials on non-human subjects. The vaccines caused an immune response that protected animals against a SARS-CoV-2 infection that causes Covid-19.Vaccine ingredientsIngredients of four major Covid-19 vaccines are available to check on the websites of either manufacturers or health authorities: Oxford–AstraZeneca, Pfizer–BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna.Reporting adverse eventsVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a tool to report adverse events from vaccination. It is a passive reporting system, meaning it relies on individuals to send in reports of their experiences, according to the system’s official website.“Anyone can submit a report to VAERS, including parents and patients,” it reads. In particular, healthcare providers are required by law to report adverse events; regardless of whether the vaccine is thought to have caused the adverse event.PCR testsA PCR test diagnoses people who are currently infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19.The test, which involves collecting a swab sample from a person’s nose or throat, is considered the most accurate and reliable test for Covid-19, according to Cleveland Clinic,  a nonprofit American academic medical centre based in Cleveland, Ohio.AFP has debunked hundreds of false claims about vaccines and the pandemic, which are available here.",,False ‘reasons’ to refuse Covid-19 vaccines circulate online,,,,,,

This is false; the Republican Guard did not resign, and it is tasked with presidential palace security, not his direct physical safety.""Protective Detail of France President ALL Resign over COVID Restrictions; will no longer protect President Macron,"" reads the headline of a July 24, 2021 article on the website of the Hal Turner Radio Show, a conspiracy-oriented program AFP has fact-checked before. Below the headline, a photo shows members of the Garde Républicaine, or Republican Guard, an elite French army corps tasked with special missions. Screenshot of an online article taken on July 26, 2021""The Republican Guard, a security detail established to protect the President of France, have ALL resigned, and will no longer protect President Macron!"" the article says of the 2,800-strong force.The Covid-19 restrictions mentioned in the headline refer to a decree by Macron that required proof of Covid-19 vaccination or a negative test to be able to attend events or enter places with more than 50 people. The ""health pass"" will be extended to restaurants, cafes and shopping centers in August. This was formalized into law by the country's parliament on July 25, 2021, despite widespread protests against it.However, the Republican Guard did not resign in relation to this law, and is not tasked with the French president's immediate physical safety.The unit responsible for direct personal protection of the French head of state is the Groupe de sécurité de la présidence de la République, whose members hail from both the police and the Gendarmerie.The Republican Guard is a French army unit tasked with ""public safety missions and protocol representation,"" according to its official webpage. Its members are not in charge of the direct safety of the French president like the US Secret Service, but they indirectly play this role by ensuring the security of the Elysee Palace, where the president lives. A spokesperson for the Gendarmerie told AFP on July 26, 2021 that the Republican Guard ""is still"" performing its palace duties. The Gendarmerie is a branch of the French army tasked with law enforcement roles, to which the Republican Guard answers. On social media, neither the Garde Républicaine nor the Gendarmerie, nor any French media, mentioned a mass resignation of the force's members.The false claims regarding the Republican Guard began when Martine Wonner, an independent member of parliament in France, claimed in a video that the force no longer wished to protect Macron.Wonner is a Covid-skeptic who was part of the government's party before she was ousted due to her controversial stances.She also faced calls from her opposition party to quit that group after she urged people to lay siege to MPs who approved the health pass.Before the vaccine passport law can be applied, it must be approved by France's highest administrative authority, the Constitutional Council, which will vote on it on August 5.",,French president's security detail did not resign over Covid-19 bill,,,,,,
