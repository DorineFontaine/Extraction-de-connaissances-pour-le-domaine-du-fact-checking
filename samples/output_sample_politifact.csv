Now the group is back in the news with a lawsuit that includes a new claim.   ""45,000 confirmed dead from the COVID-19 shots within three days… and they’ve covered it up,"" said a viral Instagram post that cited the lawsuit.

The number of deaths appears to have been fabricated by an unidentified woman, who did not reveal her method for calculating it.   The lawsuit says whistleblower Jane Doe — who it says is not identified by her real name because of concerns about personal safety and losing her job — is ""a computer programmer with subject matter expertise in the healthcare data analytics field, and access to Medicare and Medicaid data maintained by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services."" The lawsuit and an addendum say that in order to calculate her estimate of deaths, Doe examined data from the government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and compared it with medical claims related to vaccines and patient deaths from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.  The lawsuit says Doe determined that ""the number of deaths occurring with (sic) 3 days of injection with the Vaccines exceeds those reported by VAERS by a factor of at least 5.""

VAERS is an open system that contains reports that can be submitted by anyone and are not verified.   The woman used the figure of 9,048 deaths as a starting point for her calculations, according to the lawsuit. That was how many deaths associated with the vaccine had been reported to VAERS as of July 9, the lawsuit asserts. The number appears to be inaccurate, though, since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that through July 19, VAERS received 6,207 reports of death among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine.   And even though the agency has received more than 6,000 reports of death to its database, ""a review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines,"" according to the CDC.   The lawsuit was filed on behalf of America’s Frontline Doctors. The group’s 2020 viral video falsely claimed that the coronavirus has a cure and also made misleading claims about state hydroxychloroquine restrictions, coronavirus case numbers and the impact of nationwide shutdown orders.

U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., is flipping the script and saying that all congressional Republicans voted to defund police this year when they opposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan.  ""Every Republican in Congress voted to defund police when they voted against the American Rescue Plan,"" Scott tweeted on July 12.   Scott represents Virginia’s 3rd congressional district, stretching from Norfolk and parts of Chesapeake north through Newport News and west through Franklin.   His claim, echoing a Democratic talking point, melts under scrutiny. Here’s why.  The Facts  The term ""defunding police'' arose after the 2020 killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Many advocates say it does not mean abolishing police, but rather reallocating some of the money and the duties that have traditionally been handled by police departments.  For example, instead of dispatching police for routine calls involving drug abuse or mental health issues, advocates say it would be better to send officials from social service departments who have training in treating people with those problems. Some of the funds going to police, they say, would be better spent treating mental illness and addiction. Theoretically, that would allow police to put more focus on violent crime.  The defund police movement became an attack line for Republicans in 2020, and many Democrats, including President Joe Biden, repeatedly disassociated themselves from it. Moderate Democrats, including Sen. Mark Warner and Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, said progressives’ calls for defunding police were a large reason congressional Democrats didn’t win as many seats as expected last fall.  The American Rescue Plan passed Congress in March 2021 with no Republican support. The $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package provides aid to individuals, small businesses, nonprofits and the tourism industry. Included in that amount is $350 billion to help state, local and tribal governments recoup revenues they lost because of the coronavirus crisis. The law gives governments choices for using the money, including providing ""premium pay to essential workers or provid(ing) grants to employers of essential workers during the COVID-19 emergency.""  In other words, the law does not require governments to spend the aid on essential workers such as police, teachers or medical technicians; it gives them the option to. When lawmakers voted on the bill, there was no guarantee that localities would funnel some of the money to police departments. And the bill did not cut funding to any department. So a vote against the bill giving the states and localities a one-time injection of extra cash was not tantamount to a vote to defund police.  Republican leaders never mentioned police funding in their list of reasons for voting against the bill. They criticized the cost of the package, charged that it was filled with Democratic pet projects, and said only a small portion of the money was specifically designated for spending on the coronavirus vaccines. Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on June 22, 2021 in a social media post“The WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION recently reversed its stance on children getting the Covid vaccine.”By Victoria Knight • June 24, 2021  Scott’s explanation  We asked Scott’s office to back up his statement. Austin Barbera, his press secretary, wrote in an email that the act ""was intended to replace lost revenue during the pandemic and to continue to keep emergency services and cops on the job – among other things.""  Barbera sent an NBC article noting that communities in at least 10 congressional districts represented by Republicans who opposed the bill are using some of its relief funds to help their police departments.   He also noted that House Republicans unanimously voted against a separate, $1.9 billion bill to secure the U.S. Capitol after the Jan. 6 insurrection. The measure passed the House on a 219-212 vote and is pending in the Senate. Among other things, it would cover costs the Capitol Police and other security forces incurred in quelling the riot.  ""These are just two examples of how House Republicans have all voted against funding the police just this year,"" Barbera said.  It should be pointed out, however, that the bill would offer one-time supplements to the security forces and pay for a long list of capital improvements. Opposing the bill does not rise to a vote to take away existing funding.  Finally, we should note that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Cedric Richmond, a senior White House adviser, have also accused Republicans of defunding police by opposing the stimulus plan.   Our ruling   Scott tweeted, ""Every Republican in Congress voted to defund the police when they voted against the American Rescue Plan.""  The $1.9 trillion stimulus dedicates $350 billion to compensating state, local and tribal governments for lost revenues during the coronavirus crisis. The law gives the governments wide flexibility in using the money, and one option is to spend it on essential workers or their departments.   But the bill never guaranteed that the money would go to essential workers — including police and their departments — when Republicans voted against it. And there’s a huge difference between voting against a possible one-time cash injection into police departments and cutting their existing funding, as Scott implied.  We rate Scott’s statement False.","https://twitter.com/BobbyScott,https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/525983-warner-blames-democratic-losses-on-defund-the-police,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/webb-spanberger-defund-attacks/2020/11/11/9afd6408-2426-11eb-952e-0c475972cfc0_story.html,https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/actions?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr1319%22%5D%7D&r=1&s=2,https://www.republicanleader.senate.gov/newsroom/remarks/democrats-using-crisis-to-check-off-unrelated-liberal-priorities,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/feb/26/mitch-mcconnell/how-much-goes-covid-19-vaccines-stimulus-bill/,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/facebook-posts/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jun/24/facebook-posts/who-did-not-reverse-its-position-kids-and-covid-19/,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-republicans-who-opposed-covid-aid-still-see-funds-flow-n1272727,https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3237?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr3237%22%5D%7D&s=2&r=1,https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/62921-1,https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/fox-news-sunday-on-june-27-2021",Scott falsely accuses GOP of defunding police,"Public Safety,Stimulus,Coronavirus,Virginia,Bobby  Scott,Public Safety,Stimulus,Coronavirus,Virginia,Bobby  Scott",,,,,

Federal funds reimburse health care providers for administering the vaccines to people who don’t have health insurance.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has been an outspoken critic of vaccines and masks to stop the spread of COVID-19. After she tweeted that the disease was a threat only to people who are obese or over 65 — very inaccurate medical guidance — Twitter banned her for 12 hours.  Greene held a news conference and was promptly asked if she herself was vaccinated.  ""Your first question is a violation of my HIPAA rights,"" Greene said July 20. ""You see, with HIPAA rights, we don’t have to reveal our medical records, and that also involves our vaccine records.""  HIPAA is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and it contains rules governing the privacy of medical information.   But the law has no bearing on whether Greene can be asked about her medical history, according to both legal experts and official HIPAA guidelines. Whether she answers is a matter of personal choice, not the law.  The U.S. Health and Human Service Department summarizes HIPAA as setting ""rules and limits on who can look at and receive your health information."" This mainly targets insurance companies and health care providers, which are among the parties the law calls ""covered entities."" These entities can’t share your health records without your permission. If they do, they face stiff penalties.   Notably, employers are not on the list of covered entities.  Greene described HIPAA as though it conferred a special protection against being asked about her medical history. Mark Rothstein, a University of Louisville law professor specializing in HIPAA, said Greene is mistaken.

""The individual does not have to release the health information, but then they may not be hired or offered insurance.""    On the specific matter of vaccination status, employers are free to ask workers if they have gotten the shot.

Our ruling  Greene said questions from reporters about whether she’s been vaccinated violate her HIPAA rights.   That’s not true. HIPAA gives people the right to control how hospitals and insurance companies share their medical records, but it gives no blanket protection against being asked health questions, or having to answer them.   Employers may ask employees if they are vaccinated, without running afoul of HIPAA, according to federal guidelines.   Greene can sidestep the question as a matter of personal choice, but not because of HIPAA.   We rate this claim False.","http://v,https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1320d-6,https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/guidance-materials-for-consumers/index.html,https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/covered-entities/index.html,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/facebook-posts/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/09/facebook-posts/post-misrepresents-preliminary-data-miscarriages-a/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/may/21/viral-image/no-hipaa-doesnt-prohibit-businesses-asking-about-y/,https://www.hhs.gov/answers/if-my-employer-requires-proof-of-my-covid-19-vaccination-status/index.html",Marjorie Taylor Greene says HIPAA shields her from vaccination questions.

Ultimately, the advance payments will distribute half of a family’s expected total child tax credit for 2021. Families will receive the other half of the credit when they file their taxes.  Although many view the payments as a positive step, others took to social media to express their concerns.   ""I see a lot of people celebrating #BidenBucks like its free money,"" reads one since-deleted tweet. ""This is a dollar-for-dollar advance on your taxes. You must give EVERY PENNY of it back when you file next year. It's different from the stimulus money you may have received in 2020 (didn't require repayment).""  We found similar tweets elsewhere, including one that called the credit a ""bait & switch"" and another that described it as a ""scam.""  Will people have to pay back the money they receive from the advance payments?   It’s possible, but there are mechanisms in place to prevent that from happening — particularly for the most vulnerable families. In many cases, taxpayers will not have to pay back the money received via the advance child tax credit payments.  On its website, the IRS explains that the payments are ""early payments from the IRS of 50% of the estimated amount of the Child Tax Credit that you may properly claim on your 2021 tax return during the 2022 tax filing season.""  A family with a child age 17 or younger that has an adjusted gross income of less than $240,000 per year for a single filer or less than $440,000 per year for a couple filing jointly should be eligible to receive at least some portion of the 2021 child tax credit.   To determine eligibility for the advance payments and to estimate the child tax credit a family will earn, the IRS used 2020 tax returns (or 2019 tax returns if a family’s 2020 return has not yet been processed.)   Because the advanced child tax credit payments are based on an estimate of the 2021 tax credit a family will be eligible for, it is possible some families might have to pay back some of the money.   ""If the total (amount of advance Child Tax Credit payments) is greater than the Child Tax Credit amount that you are allowed to claim on your 2021 tax return, you may have to repay the excess amount on your 2021 tax return during the 2022 tax filing season,"" the IRS explained.  If a child turns 18 in 2021, for example, that could result in the IRS overestimating a family’s expected child tax credit. It is worth noting that the IRS routinely gets information from the Social Security Administration on valid Social Security numbers, which can be used to determine age. But if, for some reason, a family receives advance payments for a child who is no longer eligible in 2021, the money will likely have to be paid back.   Divorced parents who alternate the years they claim their children as dependents might also encounter a situation where the IRS might send child tax credit payments that would need to be paid back. Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on June 22, 2021 in a social media post“The WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION recently reversed its stance on children getting the Covid vaccine.”By Victoria Knight • June 24, 2021  But there are protections in place to prevent families from encountering a situation where they would have to pay money back, according to Elaine Maag, a tax policy expert and principal research associate at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center.  She said research shows that very low-income families are the most likely to have changing child custody situations or to have experienced a marriage or divorce. To protect those families from having to pay back money, there is a ""hold harmless"" provision in the law.   ""It essentially says if you’re single and have income of under about $40,000, you’re at no risk of paying back erroneous payments,"" Maag said.   Married couples making up to $60,000 are also protected from having to pay back overpayments of up to $2,000 per child because of the hold harmless provision.  If a family’s income drastically increased in 2021 compared to the income indicated on the 2020 (or 2019) tax return the IRS used to estimate the family’s tax credit, the outdated information could result in overpayments of the credit that might have to be paid back.   ""It would reduce your refund or increase your tax payment next April,"" April Walker, lead manager of tax practice and ethics at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, told CNBC. ""That’s how it would be paid back.""  Maag said she believes that drastic increases in income resulting in overpayments of the tax credit ""will be rare"" because families will receive the maximum amount of the child tax credit if they earn anywhere between $0 and $75,000 as a single filer (or $112,500 for head of household) or $150,000 for joint filers.   ""Most people won’t go from $0 to a $300,000 per year earnings,"" she said. ""I don’t think that situation will be extremely common.""   She noted that even if a family’s income went from $20,000 a year to $300,000 a year, the family’s child tax credit would only decrease from $3,000 to $2,000 per child.  ""Only half of that is being advanced, so it’s not a huge liability,"" Maag said. ""And that’s a really high-income family. They can probably absorb that change in their taxes.""  The payments are not taxable income. They are tax credits that reduce a family’s tax bill. Families can choose to opt out of the monthly payments in favor of receiving their child tax credit as a lump sum after filing their taxes using the IRS’s Child Tax Credit Update Portal. The deadline to opt out is about two weeks before a payment is made.   The only way a family will have to pay back the money received in the advanced payments is if the household actually qualifies for a smaller 2021 child tax credit than what the IRS estimated when distributing the payments.   Ultimately, Maag said ""we don’t know the exact answer"" to how many families this might impact.  Our ruling  A tweet said that ""you must give EVERY PENNY"" of the advance child tax credit payments back when you file your 2021 taxes.  Because the IRS calculated eligibility for the payments based on a family’s 2020 tax return, it is possible that some families, such as those whose incomes dramatically increased in 2021 or parents who alternate claiming children as dependents, could have to pay some money back.   However, ""must"" communicates a sense of certainty that is at odds with the reality of the situation. And even families that end up having to pay back some of the child credit will not necessarily have to pay back ""EVERY PENNY."" Finally, the law includes protections in place to ensure the lowest-income families will not have to pay back erroneous payments.   We rate this claim Mostly False.","https://www.whitehouse.gov/child-tax-credit/,https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/2021-child-tax-credit-and-advance-child-tax-credit-payments-topic-e-advance-payment-process-of-the-child-tax-credit#e1#e1,https://www.npr.org/2021/07/15/1016122095/the-expanded-child-tax-credit-is-here-heres-what-you-need-to-know,https://19thnews.org/2021/07/child-tax-credit-payments-moms-road-out-of-poverty/,https://web.archive.org/web/20210715160236/https://twitter.com/spankyNspronkle/status/1415702799304859652,https://twitter.com/FairWitnessAnne/status/1416480581576179712?s=20,https://twitter.com/1LookOutHill/status/1417642849462484994?s=20,https://twitter.com/_dharmadad_/status/1417588042131558400?s=20,https://twitter.com/Ary12834200/status/1416540665463246849?s=20,https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/2021-child-tax-credit-and-advance-child-tax-credit-payments-topic-a-general-information,https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/taxes/heres-who-isnt-eligible-for-the-300-child-tax-credit-payment-this-week/,https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/2021-child-tax-credit-and-advance-child-tax-credit-payments-topic-a-general-information,https://www.npr.org/2021/07/15/1016122095/the-expanded-child-tax-credit-is-here-heres-what-you-need-to-know,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/15/divorced-parents-may-want-to-opt-out-of-the-advance-child-tax-credit.html,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/facebook-posts/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jun/24/facebook-posts/who-did-not-reverse-its-position-kids-and-covid-19/,https://www.cpajournal.com/2021/05/18/icymi-a-first-look-at-the-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021/,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/21/you-may-have-to-pay-back-some-of-the-new-3000-child-tax-credit.html,https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/2021-child-tax-credit-and-advance-child-tax-credit-payments-topic-a-general-information,https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/jun/23/what-do-child-tax-credit-coming-monthly-starting-j/,https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/child-tax-credit-update-portal",Advance child tax credit payments won’t usually require repayment,"Economy,Taxes,Facebook Fact-checks,Coronavirus,Tweets,Economy,Taxes,Facebook Fact-checks,Coronavirus,Tweets",,,,,

Her post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Vaccines don’t offer 100% protection. Some vaccinated people will get COVID-19, and some of them will die.  But Lahren’s claim incorrectly conflates survival rates for the population at large with an individual’s chances of survival, which can vary widely depending on individual circumstances. And in suggesting that vaccines don’t make a difference, Lahren ignores evidence showing vaccines are highly effective at preventing infections that could cause death.  ""The statement is really well written to be misleading,"" said Cindy Prins, an epidemiology professor at the University of Florida. ""The interpretation could easily be that there’s no difference between unvaccinated and being vaccinated, in terms of chances of survival. But it leaves out what vaccines do in preventing disease in the first place.  ""The vaccine is preventing the vast amount of cases that you would have had,"" Prins added. ""And if you reduce the risk of becoming a case, then you can’t die from COVID.""   Case fatality rates, and why they’re misleading  Lahren, a Fox Nation talk show host, did not reply to our request for information to support her claim.   More than 609,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S. Estimates of the U.S. case fatality rate — the ratio of confirmed deaths to confirmed cases — are around 1.8%, according to the U.K. nonprofit Our World in Data and Johns Hopkins University. (Among the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19, case fatality rates range from 0.8% in Thailand and Malaysia, to 9.3% in Peru, according to Johns Hopkins.)  Adding in unconfirmed cases — those without a positive test result — would likely bring the U.S. mortality rate below 1%, suggesting a survival rate of over 99%.   However, experts say that the survival rate for the infected population at large is not the same as an individual’s chance of survival after getting the disease.  The chance of survival for a given individual or demographic group depends on a host of factors, including age and health history. Featured Fact-checkInstagram postsstated on June 21, 2021 in an Instagram postmRNA technology in COVID-19 vaccines was never tested in humans. By Tom Kertscher • June 25, 2021  Figures from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show how just one factor — age — increases the risk of death for a person with COVID-19.   The CDC uses people in the 18-to-29 age group as a benchmark, because that age group has accounted for the largest cumulative number of COVID-19 cases. For people in the 30-to-39 age group, the risk of dying from COVID-19 is four times as high. The risk increases for each older group, with people aged 85 and over being 600 times as likely to die.  These figures don’t take into account other risk factors, such as preexisting health conditions, that would affect a person’s chances of dying.  Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said that for 20-year-olds broadly, getting vaccinated probably wouldn't reduce their mortality rate much, but for 85-year-olds, it would go down significantly.  99% of recent deaths are among unvaccinated people  By comparing survival rates for infected people with and without vaccinations, Lahren’s claim also ignores a significant factor: the impact of vaccinations in preventing infections in the first place.   A report published July 7 by the Commonwealth Fund found that without a vaccination program, by the end of June 2021 there would have been about 279,000 additional deaths.  The Associated Press reported that only about 150 of the more than 18,000 COVID-19 deaths in May were in fully vaccinated people, according to its analysis of CDC data. That translates to about 0.8%, meaning 99.2% of the deaths were among people who were not fully vaccinated.  Preliminary data for June show a similar pattern: 99.5% of deaths from COVID-19 in a collection of states occurred in unvaccinated people, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said at a White House briefing July 1.  The CDC’s latest data on so-called breakthrough cases says that as of July 12, more than 159 million people had been fully vaccinated. With 48 states and territories reporting, there were 5,492 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among them, and 1,063 deaths. That included 272 deaths that were reported as not related to COVID-19 or in which there were no COVID-19 symptoms.  Our ruling  Lahren said: ""Unvaccinated, you can get COVID and have over 99% chance of survival. Get vaccinated and you can still get COVID and will still have over 99% chance of survival.""  Mortality data shows that some 99% of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. do not result in death, but the survival rate for the population at large is not the same as an infected individual’s chance of survival, which depends on many risk factors.  The claim also leaves out important context: the role of vaccines in preventing infections that could lead to death. Preliminary data indicate that in recent months, more than 99% of COVID-19 deaths have been among people who have not been vaccinated.  The claim contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression — our definition of Mostly False.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=359439972211165&set=a.278260926995737&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related,https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid?country=USA,https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality,https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid#what-do-we-know-about-the-risk-of-dying-from-covid-19,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/instagram-posts/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jun/25/instagram-posts/mrna-covid-19-vaccines-were-tested-humans-have-pro/,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-age.html,https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2021/jul/deaths-and-hospitalizations-averted-rapid-us-vaccination-rollout,https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-941fcf43d9731c76c16e7354f5d5e187,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/07/01/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-43/,https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html",Fact-checking Tomi Lahren on vaccines and COVID-19 survival chances,"Public Health,Facebook Fact-checks,Coronavirus,Tomi Lahren,Public Health,Facebook Fact-checks,Coronavirus,Tomi Lahren",,,,,

""Today Jeff Bezos will put 300 tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere for 180 seconds in space,"" said one tweet July 20. Other social posts made the same general point.  ""If you are reporting on the Bezos space flight … please mention the carbon emissions.""  ""They really should given Bezos trip today = more carbon pollution than avg person’s whole life but oddly most in media refuse to punch up when it comes to climate.""  In terms Americans might more clearly understand, the claim is that about 330 tons of carbon dioxide were emitted for Bezos and three companions to ride to a point about 60 miles above the Earth before coming back down. The round trip lasted about 10 minutes, of which about three were spent in weightlessness. Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is one of a handful of private rocketeers aiming to turn space travel into a viable business. His company is called Blue Origin.  Given the clouds of dust and fiery plume that come with any launch, it might seem likely that greenhouse gases would be part of the picture.  In the case of the engine used in the Blue Origin rocket, that assumption is wrong.  Conventional rocket fuels are carbon-based. The BE-3 engine developed by Bezos’ company burns liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.   ""Carbon dioxide isn’t emitted from the Blue Origin rocket that was used for today’s launch,"" said Eloise Marais, an air pollution researcher at University College London.

Marais told The Guardian that typically, rockets release 200 to 300 metric tons of carbon dioxide during launch. That didn’t apply to the Blue Origin rocket, Marais said — but the erroneous tweets shared the article in making the claim about Blue Origin anyway.  At a press conference after returning from space, Bezos said the Blue Origin rocket used ""​​the most environmentally benign propellant you can choose.""  Other private companies — SpaceX, controlled by billionaire Elon Musk, and Virgin Galactic, which took owner Richard Branson into space a week before Bezos — use conventional fuels, and do release carbon dioxide.  The Blue Origin flight isn’t a net zero for the environment, however. Marais and other researchers warn that every rocket poses a threat to the ozone layer. Whether it’s water vapor and nitrogen oxides from a Blue Origin engine, or particles from conventional rocket fuels, both degrade the ozone.   We should note that it takes a lot of energy to make most of the hydrogen used today. Those carbon emissions wouldn't come from the launch itself, but they are the reason there's a big push to expand ""green"" hydrogen production.  ""In the stratosphere, nitrogen oxides and chemicals formed from the breakdown of water vapour convert ozone into oxygen, depleting the ozone layer which guards life on Earth against harmful UV radiation,"" Marais wrote in The Conversation July 19.  Our ruling  Social media users tweeted that Bezos’ brief trip to space released 300 metric tons of carbon dioxide.   The trip released none. The rocket’s engine burns hydrogen and oxygen to carry it away from Earth. That doesn’t make these rides risk-free. They do pose a threat to the ozone layer.   We rate this claim False.

That is not a conspiracy theory. It's true.”",2021-07-14,politifact,,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson promoted a number of false, misleading and unsubstantiated claims about election fraud in Georgia in a recent segment on his cable news program.  ""It now appears there actually was meaningful voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia, last November,"" Carlson said July 14. ""That is not a conspiracy theory. It's true.""  Carlson told his viewers he was giving them the ""fact-based,"" ""official version"" of what happened in Georgia, where Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump by more than 11,000 votes in a contest the state’s Republican election officials affirmed was free and fair.   But Carlson’s account of what happened in Fulton County — a Democratic stronghold that includes Atlanta — was neither official nor true. State and local officials and election experts said his claim of fraud reflected a misunderstanding of election procedures.  ""Nothing that he brought up points to any voter fraud,"" Richard Barron, Fulton County’s elections director, told PolitiFact.  Viral clips from the segment online were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)   In the past, Fox News has argued in court that Carlson’s show should not always be viewed as strictly factual, and that his viewers expect him to stray from the truth. Asked about the July 14 segment, a Fox News spokesperson pointed as evidence not to any official record or finding, but to a July 13 press release from VoterGA, a group Carlson cited during his segment.   The group, led by Garland Favorito, is leading a search for evidence of fraud with a lawsuit seeking access to Fulton County’s absentee ballots. A critic of Georgia’s elections, Favorito has promoted conspiracy theories about 9/11, John F. Kennedy and other topics.    Supports of President Donald Trump holds signs outside State Farm Arena on Nov. 5, 2020, in Atlanta. (AP)  Here’s the truth behind the main claims Carlson made on air.  A warehouse alarm  Carlson opened his segment with a dramatic — and misleading — story about an alarm that went off at a warehouse housing ballots in Fulton County this year:   ""On a Saturday night in late May of this year, an alarm sounded in a big, nondescript warehouse in Fulton County, Georgia. The warehouse was an unlikely place for a burglary … But someone tried to do it anyway, and at just the perfect moment, 20 minutes after deputies in charge of guarding the warehouse left their post. By the time those deputies returned to check out the alarm, someone had opened the hundred-pound door to the warehouse. So what happened that night? And why? We still don’t know.""  We do know. In fact, a photograph Carlson aired on screen came from a Georgia Public Broadcasting report that explained what happened.    A screenshot of a ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" segment about alleged voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia, as seen on July 14, 2021.  The alarm that rang did not come from the part of the building housing ballots, reporter Stephen Fowler wrote in June. And the door was opened by off-duty police officers.  The kicker: The officers who opened it had been hired as private security by an attorney representing several plaintiffs in the lawsuit seeking access to Fulton County’s ballots — the very people seeking to prove Georgia’s election was marred by fraud.  Barron, the elections director, said the alarm was tied to a motion detector in an office belonging to the clerk of the superior court, likely triggered by a rodent.   When it sounded, the Fulton County Sheriff’s deputies watching the building were changing shifts, he said. That left an opening for the litigants’ hired security to approach the building.  Barron said that the county clerk had accidentally left a door unlocked, and that those officers had ""illegally trespassed"" when they opened it and entered. He said they ""staged photos to make it look as though the door was wide open.""   The ballots inside remained secured.   Double-scanned ballots  Carlson’s second allegation: that Fulton County counted thousands of ballots more than once.   Carlson said VoterGA identified more than 4,000 votes that were duplicates in Fulton County. He also cited an Atlanta Journal-Constitution report about potential double-scanned ballots in the initial count.  ""The final tally from the double counts we know about amounts to more than 3,300 votes for Joe Biden and 865 votes for Donald Trump,"" Carlson said. He added: ""We're talking about a lot of ballots, at least hundreds of ballots involved, enough potentially to affect the outcome of the election.""  Election workers do sometimes make errors, and Fulton County has had a history of messy elections, said Charles S. Bullock III, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia. But a similar claim that over 4,000 of the county’s ballots were scanned multiple times was rated False by PolitiFact.   ""There is no evidence that thousands of ballots were counted twice,"" said Amber McReynolds, chief executive officer of the National Vote at Home Institute.  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that the county may have scanned nearly 200 ballots twice before the state’s recounts. But the newspaper added that ""there’s no indication any vote for president was counted more than once in official results."" Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on July 13, 2021 in a Facebook postIn the 2020 presidential election, “4,255 ballots in Fulton County, Georgia, were scanned multiple times” and “3,390 went to Biden.”By Tom Kertscher • July 19, 2021  Georgia conducted a hand audit and a machine recount of ballots, both of which upheld Biden’s victory. For a ballot to have counted twice in the official results, it would have had to be scanned twice in the initial tally, then counted twice again during the hand audit and machine recount.  ""The chance that you are going to double scan the same batch again is, like you might as well win the lottery,"" Barron said. ""I think the odds are worse.""    Fulton County Ga. elections director Richard Barron listens during a press conference while workers scan ballots as part of Georgia's presidential recount on Nov. 25, 2020, in Atlanta. (AP)  On screen, Carlson showed a video of an election worker feeding ballots through a machine and said it ""appears to show large numbers of ballots being scanned multiple times.""  But it’s typical for election workers to have to cancel and rescan some batches of ballots, experts said. The practice is not fraudulent double-counting. It’s what election workers in Fulton County and elsewhere are instructed to do when machines jam up or fail to scan a ballot.  Investigators looked into allegations of fraud in Fulton County and found nothing, the Georgia secretary of state’s office told PolitiFact. The recounts corrected some mistakes that had no bearing on the outcome, including in two counties that went for Trump.  ""There’s never been an election held in Georgia which has been checked so many different ways,"" said Bullock.   Falsified audit tally sheets  Carlson claimed that VoterGA had found ""falsified"" audit tally sheets with ""fabricated vote totals,"" including sheets that logged hundreds of votes for Biden and zero for other candidates.  ""It certainly sounds like flat-out criminal fraud,"" he said.  The source for the claim, again, was VoterGA’s July 13 press release. PolitiFact reached out to the group for more details and did not hear back in time for publication.  But the hand audit in which these tally sheets were used did not produce Georgia’s final, certified results, Barron said. The state’s machine recount did, and it confirmed Biden’s victory.  As for the sheets VoterGA said only tallied votes for Biden, Barron said they were likely the result of election workers sorting ballots by candidate during the audit.   ""They would put these into piles, and then on the tally sheet, they would mark the number of votes cast according to the count of each of those piles,"" Barron said.  A photo from the audit shows an election worker doing just that, as USA Today reported. The outlet also reported that there were similar batches from the audit with all votes tallied for Trump. ""Since they did use the sorting method during the recount, it is possible for a batch to look like that,"" McReynolds told PolitiFact.    An election worker looks at a ballot during Georgia's hand recount of presidential votes on Nov.15, 2020, in Marietta, Ga. (AP)  Ballots without creases  Carlson said a ""whistleblower"" had captured photos of mail-in ballots without creases.   ""That's strange because of course mail-in ballots need to be bent in order to be mailed in,"" he said as the images ran on screen. ""These ballots clearly had never been inside an envelope.""  But many military and overseas voters receive electronic ballots that they print, fill out and return by mail, Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s voting system implementation manager, told the New York Times in January. These ballots are not the right size for scanners, so election workers under supervision transfer those votes onto normal ballots so the scanners can read them.  The same process occurs for ballots that get torn in the scanner, sliced when opening the envelope, or too wrinkled and bent in the mail. During the 2020 election, the process was also standard procedure in Georgia’s Republican counties, CNN’s Daniel Dale reported.  ""It is absolutely not proof of fraud,"" McReynolds said.    A Fulton County elections worker processes absentee ballots at the State Farm Arena on Nov. 2, 2020, in Atlanta. (AP)  35,000 voters moved  Carlson's final claim was that thousands of Georgia voters cast ballots from old addresses.  ""Nearly 35,000 Georgia voters moved out of their county of residence more than a month prior to Election Day,"" Carlson said. ""They were ineligible to vote. And yet they did.""  The source for Carlson’s claim was an article from the Federalist, a conservative website. The article said the figure came from an expert who compared the U.S. Postal Service’s national change-of-address database with data from Georgia’s secretary of state.  The secretary of state’s office told PolitiFact it disputed the claim. And an address change for the purpose of receiving mail is not itself proof of a change in residency that would affect voting.   Some college students might continue to vote from their home address while they go to school, Bullock said. Military members stationed at one of Georgia’s many bases could do the same.  The Federalist’s article acknowledged what Carlson did not — that those people ""may have been students, members of the military, or may have only relocated temporarily.""  Our ruling  Carlson said, ""It now appears there actually was meaningful voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia last November. That is not a conspiracy theory. It's true.""  To back his claim, the Fox News host rattled off several claims purporting to show signs of fraud. Each was inaccurate, misleading or unsubstantiated, PolitiFact found.  Biden’s victory in Georgia was confirmed by two recounts.

One of the most common complaints about the large-scale farms is the waste, which must be collected and disposed of in some way.   It’s no surprise that a case involving the waste from factory farms made its way to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, though the written decision in the case raised an interesting question: Exactly how much waste does a CAFO produce?   The court held that the state Department of Natural Resources has the ability to impose a maximum number of animals on factory farms and off-site groundwater monitoring conditions on factory farms. In writing the majority decision, Justice Jill Karofsky cited an evaluation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which stated that ""a farm with 2,500 dairy cattle is similar in waste load to a city of 411,000 people.""   But in America’s Dairyland, we know our cows. And that number seems awfully high.   Is it true that a dairy farm of 2,500 cows could really produce more waste than the population Madison, Racine and Oshkosh combined?   Let’s check it out.   Cows are waste machines  If you look at the study referenced by Karofsky, ""Risk Assessment Evaluation for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations,"" it does indeed state that a farm of 2,500 animals produces as much waste as a city of 411,000.   But, the paper was published in 2004, making it 17 years old.   So we went in search of newer information.  Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on July 11, 2021 in a Facebook postPhoto shows an electric car charging station that uses ""12 gallons of diesel fuel per hour, and it takes three hours to fully charge a car to get 200 miles. That's 36 gallons for 200 miles. 5.6 mpg.""By Andy Nguyen • July 19, 2021  A Dec. 6, 2019 report by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel likened a herd of 1,000 cows to the city of Fond du Lac, which has 42,000 residents. So, by that measure, 2,500 cows would equal a city of about 105,000 --  much smaller than Karofsky wrote.  The article also noted the largest CAFO in the state, which boasts 6,000 cows, generates about as much manure and urine as 252,000 people, roughly the size of the city of Madison. So, at 2,500 cows, the comparison point would again be a city of about 105,000.  And studies by Cornell University animal science department professors Michael Van Amburgh and Karl Czymmek, published in 2017, showed that a herd of about 340 cows can produce the same amount of waste as 10,736 humans.   That puts the amount of waste for a herd of 2,500 cows at about the same level as 79,000 humans, a smaller number, but one even further under the number cited in the state high court’s opinion.  Our ruling  In writing a recent decision for the state Supreme Court, Karofsky claimed a herd of 2,500 cows produces as much waste as a city of 411,000 people.  The statistic was part of a case that upheld the state DNR’s ability to consider the number of animals at factory farms and whether groundwater should be monitored offsite.   That’s an awful lot of waste from a lot of cows. And a 17-year-old study included the figure.  But newer numbers suggest that while cows produce a lot of waste -- up to 17 gallons of it a day, per animal -- a farm of 2,500 cows isn’t producing the same amount of waste as 411,000 people.

But if you are an undocumented immigrant and 55 or older, you’re eligible for Medicaid.”",2021-07-13,politifact,,"Last year amid the global COVID-19 crisis, Illinois became the first state to expand publicly funded healthcare to all low-income immigrant seniors, including those living in the country illegally.  In a recent WJPF radio interview, state Sen. Terri Bryant of Murphysboro brought up the program after a caller asked how many ""illegal aliens"" taxpayers in Illinois ""are now responsible for.""  Bryant used the question to criticize Illinois for being too soft on illegal immigration, suggesting without evidence the state’s policies are somehow connected with violent crime in Chicago and repeating a consistently debunked claim about the city having the nation’s strictest gun laws.  She also took aim at the state for expanding health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, suggesting those over a certain age are now eligible for health care benefits not available to citizens:  ""In this budget, we now allow for Medicaid for undocumented individuals who are 55 and older,"" the Republican said. ""So last year — it seemed like it stayed very quiet, I don’t know why more people weren’t talking about it — it was 65 and older. This year they slipped in 55 and older. So you may be 55 years old in this state and a citizen and not eligible for Medicaid. But if you are an undocumented immigrant and 55 or older, you’re eligible for Medicaid.""  We were curious what Bryant was talking about when she said being undocumented and 55 years or older would make someone eligible for Medicaid benefits in Illinois. After all, Medicaid is a need-based program, meaning only applicants who meet certain income requirements qualify.  We called Bryant’s office to speak with her about what her claim was based on, but did not hear back.  Applicants must meet the same income criteria as citizens, legal residents  Undocumented immigrants face limited access to healthcare, with federal law restricting them from participating in Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplaces.  In addition to becoming the first state to provide coverage for low-income seniors whose immigration status disqualifies them from federal programs, Illinois is one of six states funding its own program to cover income-eligible children regardless of immigration status. California, one of the other states that covers minors, expanded its program to include young adults in 2020 and last week approved a plan to cover low-income immigrants age 50 and over beginning next year.  Illinois moved to create two programs expanding coverage for older immigrants left out of federal programs. Last year, state lawmakers used the budget to create a program providing noncitizens living at or below the federal poverty level who are at least 65 years old with access to some Medicaid-like benefits regardless of their immigration status. The age and income requirements for that program mirror those for a version of Medicaid called Aid to the Aged, Blind, and Disabled, though the benefits for the immigrant seniors are not as expansive. Featured Fact-checkLori Lightfootstated on June 28, 2021 in remarks at a press conferenceCook County’s criminal courts “have been shut down for 15 months.”By Kiannah Sepeda-Miller • July 4, 2021  The budget lawmakers and the governor approved this year created a program set to launch by the end of next May providing benefits identical to Medicaid to noncitizens aged 55 through 64 who would be eligible for Medicaid if not for their immigration status.  Under Medicaid itself in Illinois, U.S. citizens and noncitizens with legal status 19 years and older are eligible for coverage if their income is within 138% of the federal poverty level. That same income requirement applies to noncitizens who will be eligible for the state’s new program, according to Jane Longo, deputy director of new initiatives at the Illinois Department of Healthcare & Family Services.  So, with the exception of immigration status, a 55-year-old who is undocumented would have to meet the same criteria as a 55-year-old citizen to qualify for coverage in Illinois.  Bryant drew a false comparison, since there’s no scenario in which U.S. citizens would fail to qualify for Medicaid, as long as they fell within the proper income range.  Our ruling  Bryant said ""you may be 55 years old in this state and a citizen and not eligible for Medicaid. But if you are an undocumented immigrant and 55 or older, you're eligible for Medicaid.""  This is a false comparison.  No U.S. citizens would be barred from Medicaid unless their income was too high to qualify. And the beneficiaries of the Illinois plan who are in the U.S. illegally would also have to fall below the same income restrictions.

One tweet claims the counts benefited Joe Biden, who defeated Donald Trump in Georgia, a key swing state, by about 12,000 votes.  ""Why is it that errors seem to only ever go one way?"" the tweet asked. ""VoterGA says 4,255 ballots in Fulton County, Georgia were scanned multiple times. Of those duplicate ballots, 3,390 went to Biden.""  Claims of the multiple counting of the same ballots in Fulton County were also made on Facebook. And Trump, also citing the VoterGA group, issued a statement making allegations, including fraud, in the county’s ballot counting.  The tweet was highlighted to PolitiFact by Vinesight, a company that monitors online misinformation.  Citing a history of election mismanagement in Fulton County, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on July 15 called for the firing of two of the county’s top election officials.   But there is no evidence of double-counting that would have given Biden anywhere near the number of extra votes being claimed. The double-counting that VoterGA claims it found were in what is known as a risk-limiting audit — a hand recount of the vote. After that, a second recount was done.   Statewide, the original count plus the two recounts all confirmed Biden’s victory in Georgia  The group claiming the double counting  Voter GA, also known as Voters Organized for Trusted Election Results in Georgia, says it advocates for ""verifiable auditable recount capable and transparent elections."" It is led by Garland Favorito who, with others, filed a lawsuit seeking a review of the Fulton County’s general-election absentee ballots in the 2020 election.   A longtime critic of Georgia’s election infrastructure, Favorito has promoted conspiracy theories about 9/11 and other topics, according to Georgia Public Radio, the New York Times and the Associated Press. He has also promoted affidavits signed by poll workers or observers in which they leap to conclusions about the integrity of absentee ballots, suggesting they weren’t properly marked or weren’t printed on normal paper.   On July 13, Favorito and the group issued a news release that makes allegations of fraud and other election malfeasance in Fulton County, including the allegation referenced in the tweet. The group claimed it ""found at least 36 batches of mail-in ballots with 4,255 total extra votes were redundantly added into Fulton County audit results for the November election. These illicit votes include 3,390 extra votes for Joe Biden, 865 extra votes for Donald Trump and 43 extra votes for Jo Jorgenson,"" the Libertarian candidate.   At a news conference on July 13, businessman David Cross, who is helping Favorito, displayed digital images of several ballots that he said shows ballots were scanned twice. Side by side, the ballots appeared to be identical, but contained different markings that Cross said indicated they were scanned more than once. Featured Fact-checkNational Republican Senatorial Committeestated on June 22, 2021 in an adSen. Raphael Warnock “voted for welfare for politicians plan. Up to $25 million of government money for Warnock’s own political campaign.”By Amy Sherman • June 25, 2021  Cross sent PolitiFact, and posted online, information that he said supports the Voter GA’s claim. He went further, claiming that he had found 6,415 extra votes counted in the risk-limiting audit, with an extra 5,128 going to Biden and 1,188 to Trump.   What’s been found  On the same day of the tweet, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that the people who filed the lawsuit discovered that nearly 200 Fulton County ballots had been scanned twice. The newspaper said it confirmed the double-counting by reviewing digital images of the ballots; the story included a link to the images.   However, the double-counting was discovered in a recount and there is no indication Biden earned any additional votes in the official results, the newspaper said. The ballots counted twice would have given Biden 31 extra votes. After a recount, official results reflected that Trump gained a total of 121 absentee votes in Fulton. Biden won the county with 73% of 524,000 votes cast, the story said.  As we’ve reported, two recounts confirmed Biden won Georgia.  In all, the roughly 5 million ballots cast in Georgia were counted three times, including once by hand. The hand recount uncovered more than 2,600 uncounted votes, most of which favored Trump, in Floyd County, Ga. But election officials said the mistake was due to human error, not voter fraud. In the end, the certified results showed Biden beating Trump by 11,779 votes in the state.   Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta, said: ""Given that these ballots were all recounted by hand, there is no chance that a large number of ballots were double counted.""  University of West Georgia political scientist Thomas Hunter said none of the information provided by Voter GA proves that votes in the official certified results were counted twice.   The official certified results were taken from the second recount, which was requested by the Trump campaign, he said. Even if some ballots were counted twice during the risk-limiting audit, he said, ""those numbers are not included in the official results. The official results are from the last recount, which was done by scanning all of the ballots. The results in the official count from Fulton County match quite closely to what the initial count showed.""  Hunter added: ""Any large-scale mistakes would have been found through the two recounts.""  The Georgia Secretary of State’s office referred questions to Fulton County. A Fulton County spokeswoman declined comment, citing the lawsuit.  Our ruling  A tweet says that in the 2020 presidential election, ""4,255 ballots in Fulton County, Georgia, were scanned multiple times"" and ""3,390 went to Biden.""  Some 200 ballots initially were double-counted in Fulton County, where heavily Democratic Atlanta is located — but there’s no evidence of thousands, and the double-count didn’t change the official result of Biden defeating Trump in Georgia.

And once the games are over, the beds and mattresses will be recycled into other paper and plastic products.  Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on June 20, 2021 in a Facebook postAstraZeneca means “weapon that kills.”By Ciara O'Rourke • June 21, 2021  Even though the beds look breakable, they can withstand a lot of physical activity. ""Fake news!"" said Rhys McClenaghan, an Olympic gymnast from Ireland, in response to the fast-moving social media claim. In his video tweet, he is seen forcefully jumping up and down his cardboard bed — without it breaking.  ""Cardboard beds are actually stronger than the one made of wood or steel,"" Airweave told the New York Times. The beds are built to hold up to 200 to 440 pounds.   As far as social distancing goes, the International Olympic Committee has asked athletes to minimize physical interaction, keep two meters of distance from other athletes, and practice good hygiene. Athletes are expected to be tested for COVID-19 before, during and after the games.  This year, the Olypmics distributed 160,000 condoms; officials said that the condoms were used for educational purposes to promote safe sex.

The July 11 post includes a picture it identifies as an electric car charging station in Round Rock, Texas. The accompanying text claims electric cars are more inefficient because charging stations use diesel fuel generators to produce electricity.  ""That 350kWh generator uses 12 gallons of diesel fuel per hour, and it takes three hours to fully charge a car to get 200 miles,"" the text reads. ""That's 36 gallons for 200 Miles! 5.6 mpg.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Instagram is owned by Facebook. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The charging station shown in the post is located at an outlet mall in Round Rock, an Austin suburb. However, the description of how it operates is wrong.  Electrify America, which operates the charging station, called the claim that it uses electricity derived from a diesel generator ""absolutely false.""  ""Our direct-current fast electric-vehicle charging station in Round Rock, Texas, is powered by Oncor Electric Delivery Company, one of the largest utility companies in the U.S.,"" Mike Moran, a spokesperson for the company, said in an email.  Oncor distributes electricity across the Texas electric grid but doesn’t generate its own power. An Oncor spokesperson said it’s hard to pinpoint exactly what kind of energy is used to power the Round Rock station — whether it’s derived from coal, nuclear, wind or solar energy. Featured Fact-checkInstagram postsstated on June 21, 2021 in an Instagram postmRNA technology in COVID-19 vaccines was never tested in humans.By Tom Kertscher • June 25, 2021  Similar claims linking electric vehicles to diesel generators have circulated before. A July 1 post used much of the same text, but with a different image and without any mention of Texas. It claimed diesel charging stations are ""popping up everywhere.""  The picture used in that post is actually of a diesel-powered charging station, but not anything like the public ones that are being installed around the country. This one was created as an experiment in 2018 in Australia to test the viability of using a diesel generator to charge a car in the desert.  Jon Edwards, the man who thought of the experiment, told The Driven he wanted to see whether charging with a diesel generator was viable, and how the fuel consumption for the generator compared with driving a similar-size diesel-powered car.  The experiment involved using the charger to charge 10 electric cars — most of them Teslas — for one hour each, and measuring how much energy was added to the battery during charging. Edwards used the lifetime averages for each car to convert that energy figure to an estimate of the added distance the car could travel after charging.  The experiment found that when charged this way, a BMW i3 was the most fuel-efficient of the electric cars, consuming 4.39 liters of fuel for every 100 kilometers of range added, equivalent to about 54 mpg. One Tesla model consumed around 7 liters of diesel fuel per 100 km of range, equivalent to about 34 mpg.   Edwards’ experiment found that, in most instances, using the generator to charge a car consumed less fuel than a similarly sized diesel car would to travel the same distance. A diesel-fueled VW Touareg SUV, for example, used 7.2 liters of fuel per 100 km.  Our ruling  A Facebook post claims an electric car charging station in Texas runs on a diesel generator and that a car has to charge for three hours and use 12 gallons of diesel fuel to travel 200 miles.   The company that owns the charging station pictured in the post says the station is connected to an electrical grid and does not use diesel fuel. Public chargers are generally connected to the local power supply and do not use diesel generators.   We rate this claim False.","https://www.facebook.com/qualityquilts/posts/4320988144591307,https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/instagram-posts/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jun/25/instagram-posts/mrna-covid-19-vaccines-were-tested-humans-have-pro/,https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2021/07/fact-check-diesel-powered-generators-are-not-bad-for-electric-vehicles.html,https://thedriven.io/2018/12/14/diesel-charge-evs-remote-locations-greener-than-you-think/","No, a Facebook post does not show an electric car charging at a diesel-powered station","Environment,Transportation,Facebook Fact-checks,Facebook posts,Environment,Transportation,Facebook Fact-checks,Facebook posts",,,,,

""People are either unaware or being purposely obtuse about the U.S. blockade on Cuba,"" reads the post, a screenshot of a tweet. ""Do you realize it doesn’t just mean they can’t trade with the U.S.? Cuba can’t trade with ANY country or ANY company whatsoever, threatening other people who may want to help.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Experts who spoke to PolitiFact said the claim is wrong, misinterpreting some of the nuances of the U.S. embargo on Cuba. Cuba does trade with multiple countries, but the embargo can make it difficult for any foreign companies to do business in the country.  Protests flared in Cuba on July 11, when thousands of citizens went to the streets to call for action over shortages of food and medicine, protesting for freedom against the Cuban government. The Associated Press reported that the protests were the largest since Fidel Castro’s presidency. The number of people detained by the government is not clear, but   Cubalex, an attorney group tracking arrests, estimated that as of July 19, 108 people were in detention, 78 people had been freed and 284 people’s whereabouts were in the process of being verified. President Miguel Díaz-Canel blamed the U.S. government’s sanctions for the country’s economic troubles.  Jose Gabilondo, associate dean for accreditation and reporting and professor of law at Florida International University, said that while critics of the U.S. embargo tend to use the word ""blockade"" to describe the program, the official term for the sanctions is ""embargo,"" according to the Office of Foreign Assets Control under the U.S. Department of the Treasury. That’s because the U.S. is not physically obstructing Cuba to prevent people or goods from leaving — which is what ""blockade"" means.  ""There are many people who consider that the U.S.-Cuba sanctions program violates public international law, so they see it as an illegal program,"" Gabilondo said, ""and they see it as illegal because the Cuba sanctions that are imposed by OFAC apply very broadly, not only to U.S. companies but also to foreign companies that are domiciled in other countries. So many people think that the sanctions amount to an illegal blockade.""  The history of the U.S. embargo on Cuba  The U.S. initiated its embargo on trade with Cuba nearly 60 years ago, after Fidel Castro’s regime rose to power, and overthrew the country’s U.S.-backed government. Castro’s government increased foreign relations and trade with the Soviet Union, increased taxes on U.S. imports and nationalized American-owned properties. In response, President John F. Kennedy called for a complete economic embargo in 1962, prohibiting all trade of goods and services between the U.S. and Cuba and imposing strict travel restrictions.  Twenty years later, President Ronald Reagan designated Cuba as a state sponsor of terror following its support of Marxist movements during the Cold War. The Obama administration lifted the designation in 2015, along with relaxing some restrictions, including on American travel to the country. The change meant Americans could legally bring home Cuban cigars and rum. It also permitted Cuban pharmaceutical companies to do business in the U.S.   The Trump administration reimposed sanctions on Cuba and increased financial and banking restrictions on the country. On Jan. 11, 2021, days before Joe Biden’s presidential inauguration, the Trump administration put Cuba back on the list of state sponsors of terror.  Cuba is permitted to trade with many other countries  Augusto Maxwell, an attorney at Akerman LLP and chair of their Cuba practice, said the first part of the claim isn’t accurate. Cuba can trade with other countries of its choosing — if those countries are willing as well. Some of Cuba’s trading partners include China, Spain, the Netherlands, Canada, Mexico and Brazil, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity. Venezuela was one of Cuba’s key trade partners until its ability diminished amid its own economic turmoil. Cuba’s main exports include rolled tobacco, raw sugar, nickel, liquor and zinc. Top imports include poultry meat, wheat, soybean meal, corn and concentrated milk.  Featured Fact-checkInstagram postsstated on June 26, 2021 in an Instagram postSays the Make-A-Wish Foundation will grant wishes only to fully vaccinated children.By Samantha Putterman • July 2, 2021  It’s worth noting that the OEC also lists the U.S. as one of the countries that exports goods to Cuba. Poultry counts for 90% of American shipments to the country, according to the Federation of American Scientists.  ""It’s really to favor U.S. farmers and agricultural interests. (Cuba) was a very important market for U.S. farmers,"" Gabilondo said. ""So even though the sanctions generally prohibit trade, there are some exceptions.""  Maxwell said, despite these trade relationships, the U.S. embargo does have an impact on what goods Cuba receives from other countries. For example, if any trading good contains 10% of U.S. created content, it must go through U.S. law in order to be exported into Cuba.   ""When you think of complicated things like airplanes or oil drilling platforms or scientific or medical equipment, sometimes those things are caught up in that 10%,"" Maxwell said. ""And so U.S. law does not allow that to be exported to Cuba even though 90% or 89% was produced in France or Canada, or something like that.""  Maxwell further pointed out that foreign companies that are owned or patrolled by the U.S. might be reluctant to engage in business with Cuba. The Helms-Burton Act allows U.S. nationals to sue entities that do business involving property that was confiscated by the Cuban government. The rule didn’t go into effect until 2019, when the Trump administration gave it the green light.  ""Every president since (1996), Clinton, Bush and Obama, had suspended the rule. President Trump enacted it,"" Maxwell said. ""And so in the last two years there’s been about 35-40 lawsuits filed from different folks for allegedly trafficking in Cuban properties.""   Lillian Guerra, professor in Cuban and Caribbean history at the University of Florida, called the claim ""patently false."" She said that things began to change for Cuba when the Soviet Union collapsed.  ""One by one, as Cuba adopted the reforms of 1991 and the Latin American dictatorships and right wing regimes fell, the ‘unilateral’ nature of the U.S. embargo that kept them in line and froze Cuba out of direct trade with its barrio, collapsed,"" Guerra told PolitiFact.   Guerra further stated that multiple countries have a company in Cuba, including China, Brazil, the Netherlands, Spain, France, Italy and Canada.  Our ruling  A Facebook claim stated that the U.S. embargo on Cuba blocks the country from trading with any country or company whatsoever.  Embargo is the official term used by the U.S. government to describe the sanctions on Cuba. An expert pointed out that the term blockade is used by someone who believes the sanctions to be illegal due to its broad reach.  Experts and evidence shows that Cuba can and has traded with other countries. While the nuances in the U.S. embargo can make it difficult for foreign companies to trade with the country, there is no evidence that they can’t.

In a statement on July 15, the day the GOP-controlled Arizona Senate held a hearing on an ongoing partisan audit of the county’s election processes, Trump said:   ""While this, according to the Senate, is preliminary, with results being announced at a later date, it seems that 74,243 Mail-In Ballots were counted with ‘no clear record of them being sent.’""  This and other audit findings, he claimed, showed Biden didn’t win Arizona or other battleground states.   Trump’s claim stems from remarks at the hearing made by Doug Logan, head of Cyber Ninjas, a company that was hired by Arizona Senate Republicans to conduct the audit. Logan was part of the ""stop the steal"" conspiracy theories about the election that culminated in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. Cyber Ninjas has no prior experience auditing elections.  At the hearing, Logan indicated that a clerical error could explain the 74,243 figure. He said:  ""We have 74,243 mail-in ballots where there is no clear record of their being sent. ... That could be something where documentation wasn't done right — there was a clerical issue, there's not proper things there — but I think when we've got 74,000, it merits, you know, knocking on a door and validating some of this information.""  Knocking on a door is a reference to the auditors’ suggestion that voters be visited door to door as part of the audit.  Logan claimed that what are known as EV32 files are ""supposed to give a record of when a mail-in ballot is sent"" and EV33 files are ""supposed to give a record of when the mail-in ballot is received.""  In fact, the two documents aren’t just for mailed ballots, and they capture only a limited time period. The EV32 file includes all requests that voters make for early ballots, either by mail or in person, up to 11 days before Election Day, and the EV33 file includes returned early ballots up to the Monday before Election Day, the Associated Press reported.  That means there is a 10-day period between the final day of each report, during which thousands of mail-in votes are submitted and thousands of additional voters go to early-voting centers, request ballots in person and submit them. Furthermore, the files don’t include any early ballots that came in on Election Day. Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on June 29, 2021 in a Facebook post“Military ready to act on audit results!” in ArizonaBy Amy Sherman • June 29, 2021  Maricopa County responded to Logan’s claim via Twitter, suggesting that the auditor didn’t understand early voting and used the wrong reports to calculate the number of ballots sent out by mail.  Because early voting can be done by mail or in-person, where ballots are provided at the location where voters vote, ""it's not unusual that we would have more early votes than mail-in ballots sent,"" the county said.  The county said the two files  ""are not the proper files to refer to for a complete accumulating of all early ballots sent and received.""  There’s no evidence that any mail-in ballots were improperly counted.  Joe Biden won Arizona by about 10,000 votes, flipping the state after Trump’s win in 2016.  Findings of the audit, which began in April, will not affect the  election outcome, because the results were already certified by state officials and accepted by Congress.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for his thoughts on the errant lawmakers.    It’s nothing but a political stunt that is doomed to fail, he said. And as soon as they return to the state he expects their immediate arrest, echoing a pledge made earlier this week by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.    ""There is clear legal authority to handcuff and put in leg irons legislators that are trying to stop the Legislature from being able to do business,"" Cruz said in a hallway interview. And that ""clear legal authority"" is explicitly expressed in the state constitution, a fact he learned 18 years ago when state Democrats made their last exodus to thwart a GOP-backed congressional redistricting effort.    In 2003, before Cruz became a national household name, he was appointed to serve as the Texas Solicitor General by then-Attorney General Greg Abbott. That same year, Republicans’ redistricting plans were foiled when at least 50 Democratic state House members broke quorum and fled to Ardmore, Okla., forcing Texas Gov. Rick Perry to call a special session. During that special session, the Republican effort was scuttled again when 11 Democratic state senators made their own quorum-breaking getaway by fleeing to Albuquerque, N.M.   At the time, Speaker of the House Tom Craddick asked Abbott what legal authority the House has to arrest its absent Democratic colleagues. According to Cruz, that question was placed in Cruz's hands.    ""Abbott asked me. I researched it. It turns out the Texas Constitution has a provision that explicitly authorizes fleeing House members to be arrested,"" Cruz recalled Tuesday.   But Cruz’s interpretation of the constitution doesn’t appear to be shared by all.   Interpretations of the Texas Constitution   Article III, Sec. 10 of the state constitution provides little guidance for the situation at hand. In one short paragraph, the document states that the House can ""compel the attendance of absent members in such manner and under such penalties as each House may provide.""   That language effectively grants authority over the handling of absent members to the Texas House Rules. Under the House rules, the remaining House members can issue a Motion for Call of the House, which directs the House's sergeant-at-arms to dispatch state police to find and return the missing members to secure a quorum.   ""All absentees for whom no sufficient excuse is made may, by order of a majority of those present, be sent for and arrested, wherever they may be found,"" Rule 5, Sec. 8 of the House rulebook states.    While the language uses the word ""arrest,"" there’s uncertainty about how this term is to be interpreted. Because none of these errant members have committed any crime, and the House cannot issue a criminal warrant for their arrest, they can’t be arrested in a criminal sense.   Although Cruz’s interpretation of the law finds that there is ""clear legal authority"" to handcuff Democratic lawmakers and put them ""in leg irons,"" others treat this as a gray area of the law.   The reason why this question lacks clarity is because this hypothetical set of circumstances has no judicial precedent in Texas, said Randall Erben, an adjunct professor at the University of Texas School of Law and former legislative director to Abbott. There has been no judicial interpretation of enforcement of Rule 5, Sec. 8 of the House rulebook, and thus no existing authority on the matter in Texas.  ""I'm not going to argue with the junior senator about this, but what I'm saying is there's no precedent anywhere for any of this,"" Erben said. ""He may have found some authority someplace from somewhere, but it's not going to be relevant or on point to the interpretation by a court of competent jurisdiction, which under the Constitution is the only authority that anybody has to do this."" Featured Fact-checkTucker Carlsonstated on June 28, 2021 in a show“In Texas, the power companies have automatically raised the temperature of people's thermostats in the middle of a heatwave without their permission.""By Brandon Mulder • July 9, 2021  Cruz's office, which responded to questions after this article was first published, argued that the ""clear legal authority"" stems from the U.S. Constitution, which has a similar provision regarding absent lawmakers. Cruz spokesman Steve Guest points to a 1988 case in which an Oregon senator was brought into the senate chamber by police feet-first against his will.   Because there is no material difference between the language used in the U.S. Constitution and the Texas Constitution regarding absent lawmakers, Cruz's office argues that the 1988 case shows the extent to which officers can use force in returning lawmakers.   ""Pretending that the law doesn’t clearly allow for the arrest and potential physical compulsion of delinquent legislators is patently absurd,"" Guest said.  Erben, however, said that the ultimate authority here rests in the Texas courts.    ""We’re in Texas. The only authority that’s relevant as far as a judicial review would be the Texas courts, and Texas courts have never ruled on anything about the enforcement of any House rule provision,"" Erben said.   The only time in Texas history where a lawmaker came close to facing arrest for absenteeism was in 1979. During that legislative session, an alliance of liberal senators known as the Killer Bees broke quorum for several days and evaded police by bunkering in an Austin garage. After several days, one senator, Gene Jones, left the garage to visit his granddaughter in Houston, prompting state police to search for him at his Houston home.    ""Photo in hand, they knocked on his door,"" recalled then-Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby. ""A man who looked a lot like the picture opened the door. The ranger asked him if he was Jones. He said, yes. They arrested him and took him to Austin. He was Jones all right, but not Gene Jones. They had arrested Gene’s brother, Clayton. When the knock came at the door, the senator had jumped over the back fence and stayed lost for another day.""   What does ‘arrest’ mean?   According to Sandra Thompson, a University of Houston law professor and director of the Criminal Justice Institute, the word ""arrest"" in the context of the House rules doesn’t grant officers an automatic right to use restraints or unreasonable levels of force. The use of restrains could only be used if a lawmaker posed a danger to public safety or to an officer’s safety.   ""In a situation like this, they don't even have a warrant for a criminal arrest,"" Thompson said. ""I think we really need to be thinking about this more in terms of an escort than trying to analogize it as a criminal situation.""   Both Thompson and Erben agree that absent legislators can be ordered to return to the House floor, but it’s not clear what would happen if that legislator refused compliance. The Texas Department of Public Safety did not respond to questions asking for the agency’s interpretation of the law.   ""It's at the extreme edge of parliamentary procedures,"" Thompson said. ""I don't imagine that there would be a situation where a legislator would forcibly resist. That could present a really sticky issue.""   ""Under the authority of the rules of the House, they can be made to come back into the chamber,"" Erben said. ""Now how that happens is up to every individual circumstance, every individual legislature, and every individual law enforcement officer if it comes to that.""   Our ruling   Cruz said that there is ""clear legal authority to handcuff and put in leg irons legislators"" who break quorum.  The Texas House Rules states that absent lawmakers can ""be sent for and arrested, wherever they may be found."" But, because absent lawmakers aren’t charged with a crime, it’s unclear how the use of the word ""arrest"" should be interpreted in this context. This is because no Texas court has reviewed how this provision is to be enforced. Thus, there is no legal clarity.   We rate this claim False.

The emails were publicized in a Facebook post on the group’s page and an accompanying article on the organization’s website. In the Facebook post, which was published on July 6 and shared more than 500 times, the group wrote that ""it’s time to outlaw abortion and criminally prosecute those who abuse the bodies of children.""    The claims do not accurately represent how UCSF obtains and uses fetal tissue. But that did not stop activists from gathering at the San Francisco Department of Public Health on July 14.  The protest was livestreamed on Live Action’s Facebook page, racking up 35,000 views. Holding signs that read ""end live dismemberment"" and ""human rights begin in the womb,"" activists chanted ""do no harm"" and ""UCSF, we know what you do.""  Facebook flagged the posts as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed, so we decided to break down the claims. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook.)  The emails  Pro-Life San Francisco, an organization affiliated with Live Action, said it obtained emails between UCSF employees through the California Public Records Act, which requires government entities, including public universities, to make certain documents and records available to members of the public upon request.  The emails appear to log the collection of fetal tissue, a standard practice in biomedical research. They list what type of fetal tissue was collected and the time and date.  Genitalia are among the types of fetal tissue listed in the emails. In one email, a UCSF employee states that they collected tissue from three different fetuses: a ""testis [and] bladder,"" a ""penis [and] bladder"" and a ""clitoris, bladder [and] uterus.""  Acquiring fetal tissue  UCSF does conduct biomedical research using fetal tissue and has done so for decades — but the claim that they obtain it from murdered babies greatly distorts the truth and is not correct.  In a statement to PolitiFact, UCSF officials said the tissue used for research comes from donations, which can happen after a woman miscarries, chooses to terminate a pregnancy for medical reasons or chooses to have an elective abortion. The officials asked not to be named because of safety concerns.  ""Only tissue that has been donated may be used in research,"" officials said. ""Many women who choose to terminate or experience the loss of a pregnancy specifically ask whether they can make these donations.""  When fetal tissue is donated to research as the result of an elective abortion, officials said donations are made with written consent from women after they have ""independently"" decided to terminate their pregnancy.  ""The [Live Action] article inaccurately implies throughout, through words such as ‘procure’ and ‘harvest,’ that these abortions are being performed in order to obtain tissue, which is false,"" officials said.  Live Actions’ article also claims that ""the labor induction abortion techniques used in these facilities to procure ‘fresh’ parts can result in live births as often as 50% of the time."" To support this claim, the article cites a study published in 2011 on abortion in the second trimester. Featured Fact-checkInstagram postsstated on June 21, 2021 in an Instagram postmRNA technology in COVID-19 vaccines was never tested in humans.By Tom Kertscher • June 25, 2021  That study applies only to medical abortions induced with misoprostol, a drug that causes the uterus to cramp and expel a fetus. Medical abortions make up more than a third of all abortions at over 8 weeks gestation in the United States. Typically, women are first given mifepristone, a drug that stops the absorption of progesterone in the womb, which fetuses need to survive.  The study states that ""survival with misoprostol for labor induction abortion at greater than 18 weeks ranges from 0% to 50%."" It cites research from 2002 on using misoprostol to facilitate mid-trimester abortions to support the claim. In that study, women were given just misoprostol, without taking mifepristone beforehand.   The scientists behind that research note in the study that ""live birth is a potential complication of any mid-trimester medical induction,"" but that their research is ""limited"" by the study’s sample size, since 47 women participated and just 23 of them were treated with misoprostol. The end of the article encourages further research.  UCSF offers medical abortions, among other reproductive health services, at a clinic called the Women’s Options Center. Healthcare workers at the clinic use both mifepristone and misoprostol, and UCSF officials said there has never been a live birth during an abortion procedure.  Why collect genitalia?  Fetal tissue is used for many different types of research that helps advance scientific understanding of fetal development and can lead to new drugs and cures for a variety of conditions.  By examining and conducting research with fetal tissue, researchers at UCSF have been able to further understand how the urinary tract develops in men and women, how genital malformations occur and the impact of fetal environment on the development of male and female reproductive organs.  ""Tissues that have been donated to research after a miscarriage or abortion can offer significant insights that researchers would not otherwise be able to learn and translate into treatments for a range of diseases and illnesses,"" officials said.  For many years, researchers at UCSF also used fetal tissue to study HIV and test new drugs that could help treat the disease. That research was supported with money from the National Institutes of Health, funding which was halted in 2019 after President Donald Trump’s administration announced new restrictions on government dollars going to research involving human fetal tissue.  UCSF officials said research with fetal tissue is conducted ""in full compliance with federal and state law, and within the ethical standards established by preeminent scientific societies and professional research associations.""  Our rating  Live Action’s posts claimed that UCSF is ""harvesting the clitorises, testicles and penises of murdered babies.""  The emails Live Action cites are real and it is true that UCSF conducts biomedical research using human fetal tissue, including fetal tissue from the genitals. However, the social media posts suggest that UCSF is purposefully killing children to obtain this tissue, which is wildly misleading and inaccurate.  The tissue used by UCSF scientists is donated by women who have miscarried, have terminated their pregnancies for medical reasons or have elected to have an abortion. In the case of elective abortions, women are only offered the option of donating fetal tissue after they have independently made the decision to terminate a pregnancy.  Furthermore, in an article posted to Live Action’s website that accompanied their initial social media post, the group claims that abortion techniques used to obtain fetal tissue often result in live births, suggesting that healthcare workers obtain fetal tissue from live fetuses.  Athough the group cites a scientific study to back up their claim, the study pertains only to abortions facilitated solely with misoprostol, a drug that causes the uterus to cramp and expel a fetus. At UCSF’s clinics, medical abortions are conducted using mifepristone, a feticidal drug, before misoprostol is administered to finish the abortion process. UCSF officials said there has never been a live birth during an abortion procedure at any of their clinics.  UCSF’s biomedical research and acquisition of fetal tissue is legal and adheres to ethical guidelines. It is clear that Live Action’s posts take the university’s emails out of context and disregard the facts.  Therefore, we rate this post False.

By summer, the Food and Drug Administration had revoked its authorization for hydroxychloroquine to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients and warned of serious health and safety issues.  But interest in hydroxychloroquine persists. A study published in May — on a ""preprint"" website that publishes studies that have not been fully vetted — said hydroxychloroquine boosts survival in coronavirus patients. Trump has since claimed he was right all along about the drug, a claim we found questionable.  In a viral Facebook post, social media users claimed that two headlines on stories by the same author show CNN published contradictory reports about hydroxychloroquine in April and June 2020.  The post, which juxtaposes images of the two headlines, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The April headline said President Trump was ""wrong in so many ways"" about hydroxychloroquine, while the July headline said a study found that the drug ""helped coronavirus patients survive better."" The conflicting tone, the post author argues in the accompanying caption, represents a ""lie"" by the media meant to impugn Trump.  The stories, though, did not contain conflicting information.   The April story addressed four specific claims Trump had made about hydroxychloroquine: when information would be available about whether the drug works against coronavirus; whether a French study of the drug was reputable; whether some people had tried to delay the trials of hydroxychloroquine; and whether the drug was safe for coronavirus patients.  Featured Fact-checkInstagram postsstated on June 23, 2021 in an Instagram postFuneral directors say “no one is dying from COVID” and ""the only ones dying are from the vaccine.""By Jason Asenso • June 29, 2021  The July story was about a different issue: the findings of a study by the Henry Ford Health System in Michigan about the survival rate for hospitalized patients who had been given hydroxychloroquine.      The only overlap between the two stories was the question of whether the drug is safe for coronavirus patients. The April story said that Trump called it safe, but that doctors said ""the drug can have serious side effects."" The July story said the Henry Ford study showed that hydroxychloroquine improved survival in hospitalized coronavirus patients, but it also detailed other researchers' skepticism about how the study was conducted.    For the July story, early versions of the headline matched the image in the Facebook post and said, ""Study finds hydroxychloroquine helped coronavirus patients survive better,"" according to our analysis of the CNN webpage through the Wayback Machine, an internet archive service. But later versions of the story had a longer headline that more clearly described the limitations of the study findings: ""Study finds hydroxychloroquine may have boosted survival, but other researchers have doubts.""   A year after the two CNN stories were published, hydroxychloroquine remains unproven as a treatment for coronavirus.  A National Institutes of Health study published in November 2020, based on a randomized controlled trial — the highest standard of evidence — concluded that compared with a placebo, hydroxychloroquine provides no benefit to hospitalized COVID-19 patients.  Our ruling  Social media users claimed in a Facebook post that the headlines on two stories by the same author show CNN published contradictory reports about hydroxychloroquine in 2020.   The April headline said President Trump was ""wrong in so many ways"" about hydroxychloroquine, while the July headline said a study found that the drug ""helped coronavirus patients survive better.""   But the stories did not contain conflicting information.
