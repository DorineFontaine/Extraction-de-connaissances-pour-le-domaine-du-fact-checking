First of all, he said that the virus had not killed more than 100,000 people, because many of the deaths recorded may have been people who were infected with Covid, but died for other reasons. This is not true. The daily data on the number of people who have died after a positive test does include some people who died for other reasons. However, we also have data from death certificates, which records whether or not Covid itself was the “underlying cause”. This shows that up to 2 July this year, 124,082 people died with Covid as the underlying cause of death in England and Wales alone. Lord Sumption went on to say that the people who died of Covid would soon have died anyway. He said: “At the age which they had reached, they would probably have died within a year after, as even Professor Ferguson has I think admitted.""  [1.19.00] This is not supported by the evidence. The mention of Professor Ferguson seems to be a reference to the government’s former scientific advisor’s comments before the Science and Technology Select Committee on 25 March 2020, when he said that the proportion of people dying of Covid in 2020 who would have died that year anyway “might be as much as half to two thirds of the deaths we are seeing from COVID-19”. In other words, he was talking at a very early stage of the pandemic about what might be seen by the end of the year, not stating a fact, or predicting what the facts would be. Research suggests that people dying of Covid lost far more than a year of life—about a decade on average. We have written about this in detail before.  Lord Sumption also said: ""The number of people who have died who are not in highly vulnerable groups who have died without a sufficiently serious comorbidity to appear on the death certificate is very small. It's a matter of hundreds and not thousands."" [1.19.42] This is not true either. It seems that Lord Sumption is talking about the number of death certificates that mention Covid as the underlying cause but do not mention any pre-existing medical condition. There were 15,883 of these deaths in England and Wales alone, up to the end of March 2021. All of them had Covid as the underlying cause.

The video includes many outdated or untrue claims about the Covid-19 pandemic.  The video claims that “asymptomatic carriers of Covid do not spread disease.” At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, there was uncertainty about how much transmission of SARS-CoV-2 would occur from people who had asymptomatic infections.  Over the course of 2020 and 2021, however, the role of asymptomatic transmission has become clearer and we now know that people with asymptomatic infection can transmit Covid-19.  We have written more about this previously.  In the video, it is claimed that face masks “do not work to stop the virus”. The role of face masks in preventing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was uncertain at the beginning of the pandemic.  The evidence and guidance around mask use has evolved since to give support to the use of masks in some situations. We have written more about the intricacies of this previously.  The UK government now states that mask wearing can “reduce the spread of coronavirus droplets in certain circumstances, helping to protect others”. This is echoed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) advice that, in addition to other measures, “masks are a key measure to suppress transmission and save lives.” Depending on the type of mask used, their main effect may be in protecting others, while some particular types of masks provide additional protection for the wearer. As England moves into the next stage of easing coronavirus restrictions on 19 July, legal obligations to wear face masks are set to be removed (although people will still be expected to wear them in crowded indoor areas). The legal requirement to wear masks is still currently in place in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The video also claims that face masks “cut the oxygen ‘hypoxically’ low.” Hypoxia is a medical term for low or insufficient oxygen levels in the body. The claim that  face masks can cause hypoxia is not true, and has been fact checked many times before.  The WHO have said that, while facemasks can be uncomfortable, surgical face masks do not lead to oxygen deficiency.  Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine at the University of East Anglia, conducted a review of the evidence on mask-wearing in April 2020 and previously told Full Fact that ordinary face masks and coverings do not cause low oxygen levels.  There is some evidence that some specific types of respirator masks used in medical settings (N95/FFP2 masks) can alter gas exchange.","https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1174411289694325,https://ocgov.granicus.com/player/clip/3714?view_id=&caption_id=10188788&redirect=true,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/890001/s0005-are-asymptomatic-people-with-2019ncov-infectious-280120-sage4.pdf,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/890148/s0185-clinical-virology-sars-cov-2-170220-sage8.pdf#page=1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219423/,https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/928699/S0740_Fifty-sixth_SAGE_meeting_on_Covid-19.pdf#page=4,https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/198833/whole-town-study-reveals-more-than-40/,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03141-3,https://fullfact.org/online/david-icke-makes-false-claim-that-vaccines-are-gene-therapy/,https://post.parliament.uk/covid-19-july-update-on-face-masks-and-face-coverings-for-the-general-public/,https://fullfact.org/health/evidence-shows-masks-do-offer-protection-covid-19/,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-masks,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-coronavirus-press-conference-5-july-2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51205344,https://gov.wales/face-coverings-guidance-public,https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-public-use-of-face-coverings/,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-face-coverings,https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hypoxia,https://patient.info/doctor/respiratory-failure,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/53108405,https://fullfact.org/health/masks-not-harmful/,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters#oxygen,https://fullfact.org/online/mask-graphic-wrong/?fbclid=IwAR16q6M879DK9Ve-oZl4fDnyR4OTjz6jjIiCkzkFgb9eCvn9h7abrM1FLSQ,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters#oxygen,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049528v1.full.pdf,https://fullfact.org/health/masks-not-harmful/,https://fullfact.org/online/mask-graphic-wrong/?fbclid=IwAR16q6M879DK9Ve-oZl4fDnyR4OTjz6jjIiCkzkFgb9eCvn9h7abrM1FLSQ,https://fullfact.org/health/masks-not-harmful/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/death-rate-statistics-Covid-19/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Video shares falsehoods about face masks and asymptomatic spread of Covid-19,,,,,,

The claim that  face masks can cause hypoxia is not true, and has been fact checked many times before.  The WHO have said that, while facemasks can be uncomfortable, surgical face masks do not lead to oxygen deficiency.  Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine at the University of East Anglia, conducted a review of the evidence on mask-wearing in April 2020 and previously told Full Fact that ordinary face masks and coverings do not cause low oxygen levels.  There is some evidence that some specific types of respirator masks used in medical settings (N95/FFP2 masks) can alter gas exchange.","https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1174411289694325,https://ocgov.granicus.com/player/clip/3714?view_id=&caption_id=10188788&redirect=true,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/890001/s0005-are-asymptomatic-people-with-2019ncov-infectious-280120-sage4.pdf,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/890148/s0185-clinical-virology-sars-cov-2-170220-sage8.pdf#page=1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219423/,https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/928699/S0740_Fifty-sixth_SAGE_meeting_on_Covid-19.pdf#page=4,https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/198833/whole-town-study-reveals-more-than-40/,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03141-3,https://fullfact.org/online/david-icke-makes-false-claim-that-vaccines-are-gene-therapy/,https://post.parliament.uk/covid-19-july-update-on-face-masks-and-face-coverings-for-the-general-public/,https://fullfact.org/health/evidence-shows-masks-do-offer-protection-covid-19/,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-masks,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-coronavirus-press-conference-5-july-2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51205344,https://gov.wales/face-coverings-guidance-public,https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-public-use-of-face-coverings/,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-face-coverings,https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hypoxia,https://patient.info/doctor/respiratory-failure,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/53108405,https://fullfact.org/health/masks-not-harmful/,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters#oxygen,https://fullfact.org/online/mask-graphic-wrong/?fbclid=IwAR16q6M879DK9Ve-oZl4fDnyR4OTjz6jjIiCkzkFgb9eCvn9h7abrM1FLSQ,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters#oxygen,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049528v1.full.pdf,https://fullfact.org/health/masks-not-harmful/,https://fullfact.org/online/mask-graphic-wrong/?fbclid=IwAR16q6M879DK9Ve-oZl4fDnyR4OTjz6jjIiCkzkFgb9eCvn9h7abrM1FLSQ,https://fullfact.org/health/masks-not-harmful/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/death-rate-statistics-Covid-19/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Video shares falsehoods about face masks and asymptomatic spread of Covid-19,,,,,,
6,,,,Other,Grace Rahman,2021-07-09,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/online/hancock-video-WHO/,A video shows Matt Hancock saying the WHO told him there is no evidence for asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19.,2021-07-09,fullfact,,"A video shared over 1,500 times on Facebook claims to show a clip of former health secretary Matt Hancock saying he was told by the World Health Organisation that there was no evidence for asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19. A voiceover in the video then claims that therefore this shows there was no need for lockdown, social distancing, masks or vaccines. The video shows a short snippet of Mr Hancock giving evidence to the combined science and technology, and health and social care committees on 10 June 2021. The wider discussion shows he was talking about the situation in 2020, and the video just picks out a small part of this.  Before the clip in the video, Mr Hancock claimed that in January 2020, the consensus based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, was that people who weren’t displaying symptoms would not transmit the disease. He then went on to describe how the evidence that this wasn’t the case emerged from China, Germany, and later the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US, and Public Health England. The chair (Conservative MP Greg Clark) challenged this and went on to ask him about the minutes of a late January meeting of SAGE (the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies which advises the government) which said: “There is limited evidence of asymptomatic transmission but early indications imply some is occurring.”  The exchange, including the part shown in the video, went as follows: Chair: In the minutes of SAGE it was not recorded that the consensus is that there is no asymptomatic transmission. Quite the opposite. They are saying that early indications imply some is occurring. Matt Hancock: But the World Health Organisation advice and the clinical advice of the most likely situation that I received remained that asymptomatic transmission was unlikely. In fact, the WHO’s position was, “There has been no documented asymptomatic transmission.” As I say, given all of this debate, and this is an absolutely accurate reflection of the debate, I should have stuck to my guns and said that even if it is uncertain, and even if it is relatively small, we should base policy on that. Even though the formal advice I was receiving was that asymptomatic transmission is unlikely and we should not base policy on it, I should have overruled that. So the video does not prove that Matt Hancock or the WHO currently think that asymptomatic transmission doesn’t happen, or give evidence on whether subsequent policies were required.  Later studies on Covid-19 itself, rather than related diseases, suggest that asymptomatic transmission does make a significant contribution to transmission. The video’s voiceover also claims that the vaccines are “on trial” and “experiments ending in 2023”.  The trial completion dates are set in the future to allow for long-term follow-up, but analyses of the data from phase three trials have been published in peer-reviewed studies in medical journals. We’ve written about this claim in more detail before.","https://www.facebook.com/100057866943218/videos/vb.100057866943218/559197612112969/?type=2&theater,https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/2318/pdf#page=22,https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/2318/pdf#page=21,https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/2318/pdf#page=22,https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/scientific-advisory-group-for-emergencies-sage,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sage-minutes-coronavirus-covid-19-response-28-january-2020/sage-2-minutes-coronavirus-covid-19-response-28-january-2020#current-understanding-of-wn-cov,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/933225/S0824_SARS-CoV-2_Transmission_routes_and_environments.pdf#page=12,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-19-vaccines/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/death-rate-statistics-Covid-19/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",WHO advice about asymptomatic transmission has changed since the start of the pandemic,,,,,,
7,,,,False,Grace Rahman,2021-07-07,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/online/police-station-video/,"Some reports suggest Covid-19 vaccines have caused a 2,000% increase in miscarriages.",2021-07-07,fullfact,,"Many of our readers have asked us to check claims in a video on Facebook of a man filming himself in a police station making a complaint about Covid-19 vaccines. The video is over 30 minutes long, but we have looked at the main claims he makes in it here, which are about Covid-19 vaccines and tests, amongst other things. In the video, the man claims that 1,295 people have died “as a result of the vaccine”. That is how many people had reportedly died shortly after vaccination, up to 2 June, not necessarily because of the vaccine. The Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says that “The majority of these reports were in elderly people or people with underlying illness.” As the latest version of the MHRA document explains: “The nature of Yellow Card reporting means that reported events are not always proven side effects. Some events may have happened anyway, regardless of vaccination.”   On deaths, it says “Usage of the vaccines has increased rapidly and as such, so has reporting of fatal events with a temporal association with vaccination however, this does not indicate a link between vaccination and the fatalities reported.” It’s also true, as the man says, that there were just over 922,000 suspected reactions reported up to 2 June. In the same way, these reactions weren’t necessarily caused by the vaccine. The video also claims that PCR tests contain ethylene oxide, a dangerous gas. As we have written before, ethylene oxide exposure can be unsafe, but it is commonly used to sterilise medical equipment, including Covid-19 tests, and doesn’t pose any threat in this way. The MHRA recently answered a Freedom of Information request on this, explaining that the amount of residual ethylene oxide on swabs means that lateral flow test kits “are safe to use”. It also said: “In the highly unlikely event that a swab does contain a residual amount above the allowable limit, the risk to the user is still considered to be very low.” The man in the video reads out some quotations, which he attributes to the Canadian researcher Dr Byram Bridle, claiming that the Covid vaccines produce a spike protein that is toxic to humans. This is not true. We have written in detail about this before. So have many other fact checkers.  There is a protein on the surface of the virus that causes Covid-19, called a spike protein. The Covid-19 vaccines work by giving the body instructions on how to make that spike protein, so that if the body encounters it later, the immune system can generate a response that attacks the virus faster and more effectively. There is some evidence that the spike proteins generated by the Moderna vaccine can leave the site of the injection. And the spike proteins on the actual virus itself have been found in the brains of people who died of Covid-19. But this doesn’t mean that the spike proteins generated by the body from the vaccine are harmful. Quoting another doctor talking about the Covid vaccines, the man in the video says: “There are some reports to suggest there is a 2,000% increase in miscarriages.” This claim is misleading, and we’ve checked a similar one before.  Miscarriages have been reported following Covid-19 vaccinations but there’s no evidence to show that vaccines were the cause. The number reported doesn’t appear to exceed the level you would ordinarily expect. As we’ve said, the MHRA Yellow Card scheme collects reports of adverse events following vaccination, but does not prove that vaccination was the cause of any of them. It isn’t necessarily surprising that the number of miscarriages reported after vaccination has increased alongside the number of women of childbearing age being vaccinated. Just by increasing that pool of people, you would expect to see a larger number of pregnancies in that group, and therefore a proportion of miscarriages. Appearing to quote the same doctor, the man also says: “It is also documented that polysorbate 80 is contained within the vaccines and this is known to cause issues in relation to fertility.” The AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines do contain small amounts of polysorbate 80, which is also in certain flu jabs and is used as a food additive in things like ice cream. Some people may be allergic to it. But it’s a persistent myth that polysorbate 80 is linked to fertility issues. A study linking the chemical to reduced fertility in rats is sometimes cited as evidence, but the relative dose given to rats in the trial was significantly larger than humans would ever get in a vaccine.","https://www.facebook.com/100008184070258/videos/2940863029529804/,https://web.archive.org/web/20210616204557/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting#analysis-of-data,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting#annex-1-vaccine-analysis-print,https://web.archive.org/web/20210616204557/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting#:~:text=usage%20of%20the%20covid-19%20vaccine%20astrazeneca%20has%20increased%20rapidly%20and%20as%20such%2C%20so%20has%20reporting%20of%20fatal%20events%20with%20a%20temporal%20association%20with%20vaccination%20however,https://fullfact.org/online/lateral-flow-tests-ethylene-oxide/,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/freedom-of-information-responses-from-the-mhra-week-commencing-26-april-2021/freedom-of-information-request-on-use-of-ethylene-oxide-to-sterilise-swabs-used-in-testing-for-covid-19,https://fullfact.org/online/conservative-woman-vaccine-scientist-spike-protein/,https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/byram-bridles-claim-that-covid-19-vaccines-are-toxic-fails-to-account-for-key-differences-between-the-spike-protein-produced-during-infection-and-vaccination-misrepresents-studies/,https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-377989296609,https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/06/08/fact-check-proteins-covid-19-vaccines-arent-dangerous-toxins/7505236002/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jun/07/facebook-posts/no-proof-researcher-claim-covid-19-vaccines-spike-/,https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/byram-bridles-claim-that-covid-19-vaccines-are-toxic-fails-to-account-for-key-differences-between-the-spike-protein-produced-during-infection-and-vaccination-misrepresents-studies/,https://fullfact.org/online/Covid-vaccine-miscarriage-false/,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca/information-for-uk-recipients-on-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca#contents-of-the-pack-and-other-information,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-janssen/patient-information-leaflet-for-covid-19-vaccine-janssen#ingredients,https://fullfact.org/health/flu-shot-ingredients/,https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/approved-additives-and-e-numbers,https://modernistpantry.com/products/food-grade-polysorbate-80.html,https://www.anaphylaxis.org.uk/covid-19-advice/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-and-allergies/,https://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2019/09/22/bmjebm-2019-111222,https://ebm.bmj.com/content/25/6/191,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/death-rate-statistics-Covid-19/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Video of man reporting Covid-19 crimes to police is full of misinformation,,,,,,

Just by increasing that pool of people, you would expect to see a larger number of pregnancies in that group, and therefore a proportion of miscarriages. Appearing to quote the same doctor, the man also says: “It is also documented that polysorbate 80 is contained within the vaccines and this is known to cause issues in relation to fertility.” The AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines do contain small amounts of polysorbate 80, which is also in certain flu jabs and is used as a food additive in things like ice cream. Some people may be allergic to it. But it’s a persistent myth that polysorbate 80 is linked to fertility issues. A study linking the chemical to reduced fertility in rats is sometimes cited as evidence, but the relative dose given to rats in the trial was significantly larger than humans would ever get in a vaccine.","https://www.facebook.com/100008184070258/videos/2940863029529804/,https://web.archive.org/web/20210616204557/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting#analysis-of-data,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting#annex-1-vaccine-analysis-print,https://web.archive.org/web/20210616204557/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting#:~:text=usage%20of%20the%20covid-19%20vaccine%20astrazeneca%20has%20increased%20rapidly%20and%20as%20such%2C%20so%20has%20reporting%20of%20fatal%20events%20with%20a%20temporal%20association%20with%20vaccination%20however,https://fullfact.org/online/lateral-flow-tests-ethylene-oxide/,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/freedom-of-information-responses-from-the-mhra-week-commencing-26-april-2021/freedom-of-information-request-on-use-of-ethylene-oxide-to-sterilise-swabs-used-in-testing-for-covid-19,https://fullfact.org/online/conservative-woman-vaccine-scientist-spike-protein/,https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/byram-bridles-claim-that-covid-19-vaccines-are-toxic-fails-to-account-for-key-differences-between-the-spike-protein-produced-during-infection-and-vaccination-misrepresents-studies/,https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-377989296609,https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/06/08/fact-check-proteins-covid-19-vaccines-arent-dangerous-toxins/7505236002/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jun/07/facebook-posts/no-proof-researcher-claim-covid-19-vaccines-spike-/,https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/byram-bridles-claim-that-covid-19-vaccines-are-toxic-fails-to-account-for-key-differences-between-the-spike-protein-produced-during-infection-and-vaccination-misrepresents-studies/,https://fullfact.org/online/Covid-vaccine-miscarriage-false/,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca/information-for-uk-recipients-on-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca#contents-of-the-pack-and-other-information,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-janssen/patient-information-leaflet-for-covid-19-vaccine-janssen#ingredients,https://fullfact.org/health/flu-shot-ingredients/,https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/approved-additives-and-e-numbers,https://modernistpantry.com/products/food-grade-polysorbate-80.html,https://www.anaphylaxis.org.uk/covid-19-advice/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-and-allergies/,https://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2019/09/22/bmjebm-2019-111222,https://ebm.bmj.com/content/25/6/191,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/death-rate-statistics-Covid-19/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Video of man reporting Covid-19 crimes to police is full of misinformation,,,,,,

The video is over 30 minutes long, but we have looked at the main claims he makes in it here, which are about Covid-19 vaccines and tests, amongst other things. In the video, the man claims that 1,295 people have died “as a result of the vaccine”. That is how many people had reportedly died shortly after vaccination, up to 2 June, not necessarily because of the vaccine. The Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says that “The majority of these reports were in elderly people or people with underlying illness.” As the latest version of the MHRA document explains: “The nature of Yellow Card reporting means that reported events are not always proven side effects. Some events may have happened anyway, regardless of vaccination.”   On deaths, it says “Usage of the vaccines has increased rapidly and as such, so has reporting of fatal events with a temporal association with vaccination however, this does not indicate a link between vaccination and the fatalities reported.” It’s also true, as the man says, that there were just over 922,000 suspected reactions reported up to 2 June. In the same way, these reactions weren’t necessarily caused by the vaccine. The video also claims that PCR tests contain ethylene oxide, a dangerous gas. As we have written before, ethylene oxide exposure can be unsafe, but it is commonly used to sterilise medical equipment, including Covid-19 tests, and doesn’t pose any threat in this way. The MHRA recently answered a Freedom of Information request on this, explaining that the amount of residual ethylene oxide on swabs means that lateral flow test kits “are safe to use”. It also said: “In the highly unlikely event that a swab does contain a residual amount above the allowable limit, the risk to the user is still considered to be very low.” The man in the video reads out some quotations, which he attributes to the Canadian researcher Dr Byram Bridle, claiming that the Covid vaccines produce a spike protein that is toxic to humans. This is not true. We have written in detail about this before. So have many other fact checkers.  There is a protein on the surface of the virus that causes Covid-19, called a spike protein. The Covid-19 vaccines work by giving the body instructions on how to make that spike protein, so that if the body encounters it later, the immune system can generate a response that attacks the virus faster and more effectively. There is some evidence that the spike proteins generated by the Moderna vaccine can leave the site of the injection. And the spike proteins on the actual virus itself have been found in the brains of people who died of Covid-19. But this doesn’t mean that the spike proteins generated by the body from the vaccine are harmful. Quoting another doctor talking about the Covid vaccines, the man in the video says: “There are some reports to suggest there is a 2,000% increase in miscarriages.” This claim is misleading, and we’ve checked a similar one before.  Miscarriages have been reported following Covid-19 vaccinations but there’s no evidence to show that vaccines were the cause. The number reported doesn’t appear to exceed the level you would ordinarily expect. As we’ve said, the MHRA Yellow Card scheme collects reports of adverse events following vaccination, but does not prove that vaccination was the cause of any of them.

12,,,,Other,Daniella de Block Golding,2021-07-06,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/online/car-multiclaim-video/,The Covid-19 vaccines are a mass clinical trial and won’t get to phase 3 trials until 2023.,2021-07-06,fullfact,,"A video shared online features a former health worker making a number of false claims about the Covid-19 pandemic, and vaccines.  This is incorrect.  Covid-19 is the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  As we have written previously, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated in laboratories around the world many times since it was discovered.   Dr Stephen Griffin, a virologist and Associate Professor at Leeds Institute of Medical Research, previously told Full Fact: “SARS-CoV2 has been sampled millions of times over from infected people, including those originally found to be infected in China”.   We have written about the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) Yellow Card scheme many times before.  The UK’s Yellow Card scheme collects and monitors safety concerns involving any medicines and medical devices such as suspected or potential side effects. This relies on voluntary reporting from medics and members of the public and aims to provide an early warning that the safety of a medicine or a medical device may require further investigation.  According to  MHRA data up to 26 May 2021, there were around a quarter of a million Yellow Card reports for the Covid-19 vaccines.  Of those, there were 885,980 suspected reactions (because one Yellow Card may report multiple symptoms). These range from sore arms and ‘flu like’ symptoms to some of the more significant suspected reactions. It’s correct that 1,253 deaths had been reported.  But we don’t know that these reactions or deaths were caused by the vaccine, and they certainly aren’t all cases where hospitals or doctors have agreed that it was the vaccine’s fault. As explained by the MHRA “It is very important to note that a Yellow Card report does not necessarily mean the vaccine caused that reaction or event. We ask for any suspicions to be reported, even if the reporter isn’t sure if it was caused by the vaccine. Reports to the scheme are known as suspected adverse reactions (ADRs). “Many suspected ADRs reported on a Yellow Card do not have any relation to the vaccine or medicine and it is often coincidental that they both occurred around the same time. The reports are continually reviewed to detect possible new side effects that may require regulatory action, and to differentiate these from things that would have happened regardless of the vaccine or medicine being administered, for instance due to underlying or undiagnosed illness.” Specifically related to deaths reported to the Yellow Card scheme, the MHRA has said: “Vaccination and surveillance of large populations means that, by chance, some people will experience and report a new illness or events in the days and weeks after vaccination” and that thousands of deaths are expected to have occurred naturally within a few days of the millions of vaccine doses given so far, mostly in the elderly. On 7 April 2021, the MHRA issued a statement advising on a possible link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and a very rare and specific type of blood clot seen in the context of low platelets. As a precaution, because of the balance of risks from Covid-19 for young people, in addition to an individualised assessment of those who are at an increased risk of blood clots, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has advised that people under the age of 40 in the UK should be offered an alternative Covid-19 vaccine.  As of 23 June 2021, there have been 298,081 Yellow Cards reported for the Covid-19 vaccines, including just over a million suspected reactions. This included 1,403 deaths.   It’s not quite clear what this claim means. A Google search of 85% in relation to Covid-19 vaccines directs you towards the results of studies into the effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccines in people aged over 80. One, for example, is a Public Health England report into the effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccines in people over the age of 80. The report says that PHE data shows that two doses of vaccine have an effectiveness against mortality of around 85%. This means that they reduce the risk of dying from Covid-19. It does not mean that people who receive the vaccine only have an 85% chance of survival.  As a quick sense check, if the 85% chance of survival was true, it would mean that 15% of people who received a Covid-19 vaccine died afterwards as a result. Given that up to 6 July 2021, roughly 45 million first doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in the UK, this would result in approximately seven million deaths—which clearly hasn’t happened.     All three of the vaccines currently in use in the UK (Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna) have been authorised for use. A fourth, Janssen has been authorised, but is not yet in use.  Across the UK, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has a temporary authorisation (sometimes known as a regulation 174 authorisation) issued by the MHRA.  In Great Britain, the Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen vaccines have another type of authorisation, called a “conditional marketing authorisation” which has been issued by the MHRA. We have written more about the difference between these types of authorisation before.  The European Medicines Agency has authorised the use of all four of these vaccines, under its own conditional marketing authorisation. It is under these authorisations that the AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen vaccines are made available in Northern Ireland.  As we have written previously, the Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines have all had analysis of safety and efficacy data from phase three trials (involving tens of thousands of participants) published in peer-reviewed articles in medical journals such as The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine. Long-term protection and safety data will continue to be collected over the next couple of years, and so the completion dates for the trials are in 2022 and 2023.  The FDA has also authorised the use of the Pfizer, Moderna and Janssen vaccines.   It’s not clear whether it is being claimed that the vaccines themselves or the act of giving them is in breach of the ethical research principles that

13,,,,Other,Daniella de Block Golding,2021-07-06,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/online/car-multiclaim-video/,The Covid-19 vaccines are a mass clinical trial and won’t get to phase 3 trials until 2023.,2021-07-06,fullfact,,"A video shared online features a former health worker making a number of false claims about the Covid-19 pandemic, and vaccines.  This is incorrect.  Covid-19 is the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  As we have written previously, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated in laboratories around the world many times since it was discovered.   Dr Stephen Griffin, a virologist and Associate Professor at Leeds Institute of Medical Research, previously told Full Fact: “SARS-CoV2 has been sampled millions of times over from infected people, including those originally found to be infected in China”.   We have written about the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) Yellow Card scheme many times before.  The UK’s Yellow Card scheme collects and monitors safety concerns involving any medicines and medical devices such as suspected or potential side effects. This relies on voluntary reporting from medics and members of the public and aims to provide an early warning that the safety of a medicine or a medical device may require further investigation.  According to  MHRA data up to 26 May 2021, there were around a quarter of a million Yellow Card reports for the Covid-19 vaccines.  Of those, there were 885,980 suspected reactions (because one Yellow Card may report multiple symptoms). These range from sore arms and ‘flu like’ symptoms to some of the more significant suspected reactions. It’s correct that 1,253 deaths had been reported.  But we don’t know that these reactions or deaths were caused by the vaccine, and they certainly aren’t all cases where hospitals or doctors have agreed that it was the vaccine’s fault. As explained by the MHRA “It is very important to note that a Yellow Card report does not necessarily mean the vaccine caused that reaction or event. We ask for any suspicions to be reported, even if the reporter isn’t sure if it was caused by the vaccine. Reports to the scheme are known as suspected adverse reactions (ADRs). “Many suspected ADRs reported on a Yellow Card do not have any relation to the vaccine or medicine and it is often coincidental that they both occurred around the same time. The reports are continually reviewed to detect possible new side effects that may require regulatory action, and to differentiate these from things that would have happened regardless of the vaccine or medicine being administered, for instance due to underlying or undiagnosed illness.” Specifically related to deaths reported to the Yellow Card scheme, the MHRA has said: “Vaccination and surveillance of large populations means that, by chance, some people will experience and report a new illness or events in the days and weeks after vaccination” and that thousands of deaths are expected to have occurred naturally within a few days of the millions of vaccine doses given so far, mostly in the elderly. On 7 April 2021, the MHRA issued a statement advising on a possible link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and a very rare and specific type of blood clot seen in the context of low platelets. As a precaution, because of the balance of risks from Covid-19 for young people, in addition to an individualised assessment of those who are at an increased risk of blood clots, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has advised that people under the age of 40 in the UK should be offered an alternative Covid-19 vaccine.  As of 23 June 2021, there have been 298,081 Yellow Cards reported for the Covid-19 vaccines, including just over a million suspected reactions. This included 1,403 deaths.   It’s not quite clear what this claim means. A Google search of 85% in relation to Covid-19 vaccines directs you towards the results of studies into the effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccines in people aged over 80. One, for example, is a Public Health England report into the effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccines in people over the age of 80. The report says that PHE data shows that two doses of vaccine have an effectiveness against mortality of around 85%. This means that they reduce the risk of dying from Covid-19. It does not mean that people who receive the vaccine only have an 85% chance of survival.  As a quick sense check, if the 85% chance of survival was true, it would mean that 15% of people who received a Covid-19 vaccine died afterwards as a result. Given that up to 6 July 2021, roughly 45 million first doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in the UK, this would result in approximately seven million deaths—which clearly hasn’t happened.     All three of the vaccines currently in use in the UK (Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna) have been authorised for use. A fourth, Janssen has been authorised, but is not yet in use.  Across the UK, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has a temporary authorisation (sometimes known as a regulation 174 authorisation) issued by the MHRA.  In Great Britain, the Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen vaccines have another type of authorisation, called a “conditional marketing authorisation” which has been issued by the MHRA. We have written more about the difference between these types of authorisation before.  The European Medicines Agency has authorised the use of all four of these vaccines, under its own conditional marketing authorisation. It is under these authorisations that the AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen vaccines are made available in Northern Ireland.  As we have written previously, the Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines have all had analysis of safety and efficacy data from phase three trials (involving tens of thousands of participants) published in peer-reviewed articles in medical journals such as The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine. Long-term protection and safety data will continue to be collected over the next couple of years, and so the completion dates for the trials are in 2022 and 2023.  The FDA has also authorised the use of the Pfizer, Moderna and Janssen vaccines.   It’s not clear whether it is being claimed that the vaccines themselves or the act of giving them is in breach of the ethical research principles that were developed in the wake of Nazi attrocities.  Either way, as we’ve written before, medical ethics, healthcare law and social epidemiology experts have told us that the principles of the Nuremberg

As explained by the MHRA “It is very important to note that a Yellow Card report does not necessarily mean the vaccine caused that reaction or event. We ask for any suspicions to be reported, even if the reporter isn’t sure if it was caused by the vaccine. Reports to the scheme are known as suspected adverse reactions (ADRs). “Many suspected ADRs reported on a Yellow Card do not have any relation to the vaccine or medicine and it is often coincidental that they both occurred around the same time. The reports are continually reviewed to detect possible new side effects that may require regulatory action, and to differentiate these from things that would have happened regardless of the vaccine or medicine being administered, for instance due to underlying or undiagnosed illness.” Specifically related to deaths reported to the Yellow Card scheme, the MHRA has said: “Vaccination and surveillance of large populations means that, by chance, some people will experience and report a new illness or events in the days and weeks after vaccination” and that thousands of deaths are expected to have occurred naturally within a few days of the millions of vaccine doses given so far, mostly in the elderly. On 7 April 2021, the MHRA issued a statement advising on a possible link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and a very rare and specific type of blood clot seen in the context of low platelets. As a precaution, because of the balance of risks from Covid-19 for young people, in addition to an individualised assessment of those who are at an increased risk of blood clots, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has advised that people under the age of 40 in the UK should be offered an alternative Covid-19 vaccine.  As of 23 June 2021, there have been 298,081 Yellow Cards reported for the Covid-19 vaccines, including just over a million suspected reactions. This included 1,403 deaths.   It’s not quite clear what this claim means. A Google search of 85% in relation to Covid-19 vaccines directs you towards the results of studies into the effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccines in people aged over 80. One, for example, is a Public Health England report into the effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccines in people over the age of 80. The report says that PHE data shows that two doses of vaccine have an effectiveness against mortality of around 85%. This means that they reduce the risk of dying from Covid-19. It does not mean that people who receive the vaccine only have an 85% chance of survival.  As a quick sense check, if the 85% chance of survival was true, it would mean that 15% of people who received a Covid-19 vaccine died afterwards as a result. Given that up to 6 July 2021, roughly 45 million first doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in the UK, this would result in approximately seven million deaths—which clearly hasn’t happened.     All three of the vaccines currently in use in the UK (Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna) have been authorised for use. A fourth, Janssen has been authorised, but is not yet in use.  Across the UK, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has a temporary authorisation (sometimes known as a regulation 174 authorisation) issued by the MHRA.  In Great Britain, the Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen vaccines have another type of authorisation, called a “conditional marketing authorisation” which has been issued by the MHRA. We have written more about the difference between these types of authorisation before.  The European Medicines Agency has authorised the use of all four of these vaccines, under its own conditional marketing authorisation. It is under these authorisations that the AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen vaccines are made available in Northern Ireland.  As we have written previously, the Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines have all had analysis of safety and efficacy data from phase three trials (involving tens of thousands of participants) published in peer-reviewed articles in medical journals such as The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine. Long-term protection and safety data will continue to be collected over the next couple of years, and so the completion dates for the trials are in 2022 and 2023.  The FDA has also authorised the use of the Pfizer, Moderna and Janssen vaccines.   It’s not clear whether it is being claimed that the vaccines themselves or the act of giving them is in breach of the ethical research principles that were developed in the wake of Nazi attrocities.  Either way, as we’ve written before, medical ethics, healthcare law and social epidemiology experts have told us that the principles of the Nuremberg Code are not applicable to the current vaccine roll-out.","https://www.facebook.com/david.faleymartin/videos/10160548038101980,https://brandnewtube.com/watch/parents-watch-now-ex-nhs-nurse-louise-hampton-speaks-the-truth-amp-facts-please-share_QMn9Nqmmmb7NYp4.html,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-53948820,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-isolated-virus/,https://theconversation.com/i-study-viruses-how-our-team-isolated-the-new-coronavirus-to-fight-the-global-pandemic-133675,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7045880/,https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0516_article,https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0516_article,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-isolated-virus/,https://fullfact.org/health/vaccine-side-effects-express/,https://fullfact.org/online/yellow-card-astrazeneca-reactions/,https://fullfact.org/online/viral-video-covid-vaccine/,https://fullfact.org/health/do-not-resuscitate-video/,https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/the-yellow-card-scheme/,https://web.archive.org/web/20210605171951/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting#summary,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/994726/20210616_Coronavirus_vaccine_-_summary_of_Yellow_Card_reporting__v2_-_clean.pdf#page=16,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mhra-issues-new-advice-concluding-a-possible-link-between-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-and-extremely-rare-unlikely-to-occur-blood-clots,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mhra-issues-new-advice-concluding-a-possible-link-between-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-and-extremely-rare-unlikely-to-occur-blood-clots,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/jcvi-advises-on-covid-19-vaccine-for-people-aged-under-40,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting#summary,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/989360/PHE_COVID-19_vaccine_effectiveness_report_March_2021_v2.pdf,https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2021/02/23/covid-19-analysing-first-vaccine-effectiveness-in-the-uk/,https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1088,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/989360/PHE_COVID-19_vaccine_effectiveness_report_March_2021_v2.pdf#page=3,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/information-for-uk-recipients-on-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/conditions-of-authorisation-for-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca#history,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-janssen,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-vaccines/,https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/overview/public-health-threats/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/treatments-vaccines/vaccines-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines-authorised#authorised-covid-19-vaccines-section,https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/glossary/conditional-marketing-authorisation,https://www.health-ni.gov.uk/eu-exit-frequently-asked-questions,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-vaccines/,https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines,https://fullfact.org/health/nuremberg-code-covid/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/death-rate-statistics-Covid-19/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Video

The poster also claims this means they would falsely test positive after drinking.  As we have written many times before, the acidity in some foods and drinks can break a test and cause a second line to appear, as if the test were positive.  This does not mean that the tests are unreliable when used correctly, and it does not mean that the foods and drinks used to break the test are really positive for Covid-19. Lateral flow tests are unlikely to give a false positive result if used correctly. To avoid the risk of consumed food or drink affecting the result of a lateral flow test, government guidance states: “Do not eat or drink for at least 30 minutes before doing the test to reduce the risk of spoiling the test.” We have previously fact checked similar claims about ketchup, oranges, kiwi fruit and Coca-Cola.  Using food and drinks on lateral flow tests has been in the news after reports that pupils are attempting to get time off school by using liquids like lemon juice to create false positive results.","https://www.facebook.com/gem.turner.90/posts/10165545601115154,https://fullfact.org/online/ketchup-squash-fruit/,https://www.apr.cz/data/uploads/covid-19/cpr_05_diaquick-covid-19-ag-cassette_2020-09-18.pdf,https://en.joysbio.com/covid-19-antigen-rapid-test-kit/,https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Options-use-of-rapid-antigen-tests-for-COVID-19.pdf#page=4,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/957271/COVID-19-self-test-instructions.pdf#page=4,https://fullfact.org/online/ketchup-covid-positive-lateral-flow-test/,https://fullfact.org/online/orange-covid-positive/,https://fullfact.org/online/kiwi-covid/,https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/tiktok-fake-covid-positive-test-schools-1079693,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/death-rate-statistics-Covid-19/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Pouring diluted cordial onto a Covid-19 test won’t give an accurate result,,,,,,
17,,,,Other,Pippa Allen-Kinross,2021-07-02,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/news/michael-gove-public-first/,The court found there was no actual bias in the awarding of a contract to Public First.,2021-07-02,fullfact,,"During an appearance on Sky News on 15 June, Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove was asked about a recent ruling at the High Court on the government’s decision to award a £560,000 contract to marketing agency Public First during the pandemic. The agency is run by former colleagues of both Mr Gove and Dominic Cummings, the former chief adviser to the Prime Minister.  Mr Gove insisted the High Court did not find “actual bias” in the decision to award the contract, and there was no breach of the ministerial code. We take a look at what the ruling found.  The legal action was taken by The Good Law Project into the decision to award the contract to Public First “for the provision of focus group and communications support services.” It challenged the decision to award the contract on three grounds: that the government didn’t have the basis for awarding the contract without competition, that the award of the contract for a period of six months was disproportionate, and that the decision to award this contract to Public First gave rise to “apparent bias”, as observers would conclude there was bias due to the connections between Mr Cummings, Mr Gove and the directors of Public First. Lawyers for the Cabinet Office disputed the claims and argued that there was no time to run a procurement process due to the pandemic, and the decision to award the contract was based on professional assessment rather than personal connections.  They argued that “in all the circumstances of the case, a fair-minded and informed observer, who had knowledge of the facts, would not conclude that there was a real possibility that the decision maker was biased.” The claimant failed on the first two grounds. However, the judge held that the decision making process which led to the award of the contract did give rise to “apparent bias” and so was unlawful.   The ruling said: “The defendant's failure to consider any other research agency, by reference to experience, expertise, availability or capacity, would lead a fair-minded and informed observer to conclude that there was a real possibility, or a real danger, that the decision-maker was biased."" But it also added: ""The fair-minded and informed observer would have appreciated that there was an urgent need for research through focus groups on effective communications in response to the Covid-19 crisis and that those research services were required immediately."" The ruling also stated that neither Mr Gove nor Mr Cummings “had any involvement in the appointment of Public First” to carry out initial work in February 2020. This work then turned into a six month contract, awarded in June 2020. The ruling does not state whether or not Mr Gove had any involvement with the awarding of this contract. Mr Gove said on Sky News that the court found there was “no actual bias” in its ruling, something which was disputed by The Good Law Project’s director Jolyon Maugham on Twitter. What is important here is that there is more than one kind of bias. ‘Actual bias’ means that the decision-maker was prejudiced in favour or against a particular party (in this case Public First), while ‘apparent bias’ means that a fair minded and informed observer would conclude that there was a real possibility of bias.  In the ruling, it clearly states: “There is no suggestion of actual bias in this case. The allegation is that the circumstances in which the contract was awarded to Public First gave rise to apparent bias.” It also states: “It is emphasised that the court is not concerned with any suggestion of actual bias. But as explained above, the absence of actual bias is not in itself a defence to an allegation of apparent bias.” This means that the court did not find actual bias in this case. Actual bias was never alleged by The Good Law Project or examined by the court. Therefore Mr Gove’s claim that “the court found that there was no actual bias” is wrong. The Ministerial Code is a set of rules and principles which set the standards of conduct for government ministers. It is not legally binding.  The Institute for Government explains that, when a break of the UK Ministerial Code is alleged to have taken place, “whether and how it is investigated is entirely at the prime minister’s discretion.” The Ministerial Code says: “Holders of public office must act and take decisions impartially, fairly and on merit, using the best evidence and without discrimination or bias.” Labour has demanded an investigation into whether Mr Gove breached the code following the ruling. However, the Cabinet Office has said there will be no investigation as Mr Gove was not personally involved in the decision to award the contract.","https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/good-law-project-v-cabinet-office/,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-57413115,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Good-Law-Project-v-Cabinet-Office-judgment.pdf#page=4,https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/good-law-project-v-cabinet-office/,https://twitter.com/JolyonMaugham/status/1404725232246661122?s=20,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Good-Law-Project-v-Cabinet-Office-judgment.pdf#page=34,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Good-Law-Project-v-Cabinet-Office-judgment.pdf#page=39,https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/ministerial-code,https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/ministerial-code,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/826920/August-2019-MINISTERIAL-CODE-FINAL-FORMATTED-2.pdf#page=32,https://labour.org.uk/press/labour-demands-investigation-into-ministerial-code-breach-over-unlawful-michael-gove-contract/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/09/covid-contract-for-firm-run-by-cummings-friends-was-unlawful-judge-rules,https://fullfact.org/news/boris-johnson-whatsapp-covid-life-expectancy-cummings/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/what-has-prime-minister-said-about-booing-england-players/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/times-woke-survey/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/sun-cancel-culture/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/matt-hancock-private-email/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Was Michael Gove right about court ruling over bias in contracts?,,,,,,
18,,,,Other,Tom Norton,2021-06-29,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/online/Hart-Newsround-report-misleading/,Children are more likely to produce more harmful spike proteins after they’ve been vaccinated.,2021-06-29,fullfact,,"An online article by science pressure group the Health Advisory and Recovery Team (HART) has claimed a video by children’s TV show Newsround made a number of misleading claims about the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for children.  Since the video was released, Newsround made one correction in an accompanying article on its website stating “the claim that the vaccine is 100% safe has been removed from an online transcript of this article.”  It also included a statement from UK drug regulator the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).  It said: ""We have carefully reviewed clinical trial data in children aged 12 to 15 years and have concluded that the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective in this age group and that the benefits of this vaccine outweigh any risk."" However, a number of other claims HART made are themselves misleading.  HART said this Pfizer trial was “grossly underpowered” to detect relatively rare serious events as only 1,131 children received the vaccine in the trial and claimed that seven of the children in the trial had severe adverse events associated with the vaccine, one of which was life-threatening. It also raised questions over the ability of the trial to demonstrate efficacy, claiming that because the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 in children is so low, you would need to vaccinate more than two million people to detect one death.  It is true that the trial, which had over 6,000 participants, was too small to detect very rare adverse events. Dr Jason Oke, senior statistician at the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, told Full Fact “Trials are rarely, if ever, of sufficient size (or powered) to detect differences in rare adverse events and this trial...is no exception.  “So, I would say that [HART’s] statement is not incorrect but I would suggest that this issue is not unique to this study.” While seven serious adverse events were detected among the vaccine trial group, none of the events were recorded as being related to the vaccine.  HART’s assessment of Pfizer’s efficacy data (which found 18 cases of Covid-19 in the unvaccinated group, and none in the vaccinated group) appears to only consider vaccination worthwhile if it prevents death.  While the trial was too small to detect a difference in Covid-19 deaths, that was not its purpose. It set out to measure the impact of efficacy of vaccines in reducing the risk of Covid-19, and found the vaccine worked. As Full Fact and others have reported, the vaccine is not only to reduce the risk of dying from Covid-19 (which we have previously reported is close to one in 100,000 in children who catch the disease) but to reduce non-lethal but harmful symptomatic Covid-19, transmission of the disease, and long Covid. HART also cited an open letter to CEO of the MHRA Dr June Raine as evidence of the vaccines’ harmfulness, claiming it was an “independent preliminary Yellow Card reporting review (which) advises that all COVID-19 vaccination should be halted, pending a full independent safety enquiry.” The “review” argues that 1,253 deaths and 888,196 adverse reactions (ADR) reported via the Yellow Card Scheme were “covid-19 vaccine attributed”.  We’ve said on a number of occasions that reporting of deaths and adverse events following a vaccine does not mean they are connected.  Some adverse events have been investigated and are possibly linked to vaccination. The MHRA has received reports of 389 cases of blood clotting following the AstraZeneca vaccine, of which 68 were fatal. Its advice remains “that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks in the majority of people.”  Under 40s however are being offered an alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine.  According to the latest statistics, there have been 395 instances of anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions in response to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 16 instances after the Moderna vaccine and 760 after the AstraZeneca vaccine. Anyone with a history of allergic reactions to the Pfizer vaccine or hypersensitivity to the Moderna vaccine have been told to not receive those vaccines.  Reports of Bell’s Palsy (a type of facial paralysis) have been analysed but “so far is similar to the expected natural rate and does not currently suggest an increased risk following the vaccines.” There have been eight reports of Capillary Leak Syndrome (where fluid leaks from the small blood vessels into the body, which can lead to organ failure and death). While it is an extremely rare condition, whose triggers are not well understood, the MHRA has advised the AstraZeneca vaccine should not be used by anyone with a history of such episodes.  The MHRA also monitored reports of myocarditis and pericarditis (inflammatory heart conditions) following vaccination. It says the reports are “very rare”, “typically mild” and people should attend for vaccination when invited “unless advised otherwise.” A range of menstrual disorders have been reported after the Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines but the number of reports are said to be low in relation to the number of women who have had their vaccine and how common such disorders are generally. Of other adverse events with a fatal outcome following vaccination “review of individual reports and patterns of reporting does not suggest the vaccine played a role in the death.” HART also claimed that children produce more spike proteins generated by the Covid-19 vaccine.  It claimed recent evidence shows these proteins are harmful. We believe this refers to statements made by viral immunologist Byram Bridle who claimed, just as spike proteins from the Covid-19 virus can enter the bloodstream and cause cellular damage, so can spike proteins generated by the Covid-19 vaccine. While we don’t know whether children produce more spike proteins following vaccination we recently fact checked Mr Bridle’s comments. Spike proteins generated by the vaccines work differently to those generated by the Covid-19 virus, and so the assumption that spike proteins generated by the vaccine could also harm cells in the bloodstream is unevidenced..  His theory has also been addressed by a number of other scientists and fact checkers.  HART also noted Newsround hadn’t mentioned some of the Pfizer vaccine's side effects, citing a recent FDA report and an upcoming U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emergency meeting on associated myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart, which can lead to heart failure). The CDC reported earlier this month that more than half of the myocarditis cases reported to the U.S Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System after the second dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines were in people aged between 12 and 24.  This has led to the FDA adding a warning to the Pfizer and Modera vaccines.  As noted earlier, the MHRA has received reports of myocarditis following vaccination but say instances are very rare, events were typically mild and individuals should still come forward for their vaccine unless advised not to.","https://www.hartgroup.org/bbc-newsround-vaccine/,https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/57389353,https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/57389353,https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2107456/suppl_file/nejmoa2107456_appendix.pdf#page=10,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210331005503/en/,https://fullfact.org/online/risk-children-death-covid/,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-19-in-children/,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-nhs-to-launch-long-covid-services-for-children-12332812,https://fullfact.org/online/Piers-Corbyn-wrong-covid-vaccine-figures/,https://fullfact.org/health/do-not-resuscitate-video/,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-57021738,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting,https://www.ukcolumn.org/community/forums/topic/dr-byram-bridle-assoc-prof-of-viral-immunology-latest-vaccine-research/,https://fullfact.org/online/conservative-woman-vaccine-scientist-spike-protein/,https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-vaccine-safe-idUSL2N2NX1J6,https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/byram-bridles-claim-that-covid-19-vaccines-are-toxic-fails-to-account-for-key-differences-between-the-spike-protein-produced-during-infection-and-vaccination-misrepresents-studies/,https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-377989296609,https://www.fda.gov/media/150054/download,https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/agenda-archive/agenda-2021-06-18-508.pdf,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/cdc-heart-inflammation-cases-ages-16-24-higher-than-expected-after-mrna-covid-19-2021-06-10/,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/953647,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/death-rate-statistics-Covid-19/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Critical report on BBC Newsround story is misleading,,,,,,

Dr Jason Oke, senior statistician at the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, told Full Fact “Trials are rarely, if ever, of sufficient size (or powered) to detect differences in rare adverse events and this trial...is no exception.  “So, I would say that [HART’s] statement is not incorrect but I would suggest that this issue is not unique to this study.” While seven serious adverse events were detected among the vaccine trial group, none of the events were recorded as being related to the vaccine.  HART’s assessment of Pfizer’s efficacy data (which found 18 cases of Covid-19 in the unvaccinated group, and none in the vaccinated group) appears to only consider vaccination worthwhile if it prevents death.  While the trial was too small to detect a difference in Covid-19 deaths, that was not its purpose. It set out to measure the impact of efficacy of vaccines in reducing the risk of Covid-19, and found the vaccine worked. As Full Fact and others have reported, the vaccine is not only to reduce the risk of dying from Covid-19 (which we have previously reported is close to one in 100,000 in children who catch the disease) but to reduce non-lethal but harmful symptomatic Covid-19, transmission of the disease, and long Covid. HART also cited an open letter to CEO of the MHRA Dr June Raine as evidence of the vaccines’ harmfulness, claiming it was an “independent preliminary Yellow Card reporting review (which) advises that all COVID-19 vaccination should be halted, pending a full independent safety enquiry.” The “review” argues that 1,253 deaths and 888,196 adverse reactions (ADR) reported via the Yellow Card Scheme were “covid-19 vaccine attributed”.  We’ve said on a number of occasions that reporting of deaths and adverse events following a vaccine does not mean they are connected.  Some adverse events have been investigated and are possibly linked to vaccination. The MHRA has received reports of 389 cases of blood clotting following the AstraZeneca vaccine, of which 68 were fatal. Its advice remains “that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks in the majority of people.”  Under 40s however are being offered an alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine.  According to the latest statistics, there have been 395 instances of anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions in response to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 16 instances after the Moderna vaccine and 760 after the AstraZeneca vaccine. Anyone with a history of allergic reactions to the Pfizer vaccine or hypersensitivity to the Moderna vaccine have been told to not receive those vaccines.  Reports of Bell’s Palsy (a type of facial paralysis) have been analysed but “so far is similar to the expected natural rate and does not currently suggest an increased risk following the vaccines.” There have been eight reports of Capillary Leak Syndrome (where fluid leaks from the small blood vessels into the body, which can lead to organ failure and death). While it is an extremely rare condition, whose triggers are not well understood, the MHRA has advised the AstraZeneca vaccine should not be used by anyone with a history of such episodes.  The MHRA also monitored reports of myocarditis and pericarditis (inflammatory heart conditions) following vaccination. It says the reports are “very rare”, “typically mild” and people should attend for vaccination when invited “unless advised otherwise.” A range of menstrual disorders have been reported after the Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines but the number of reports are said to be low in relation to the number of women who have had their vaccine and how common such disorders are generally. Of other adverse events with a fatal outcome following vaccination “review of individual reports and patterns of reporting does not suggest the vaccine played a role in the death.” HART also claimed that children produce more spike proteins generated by the Covid-19 vaccine.  It claimed recent evidence shows these proteins are harmful. We believe this refers to statements made by viral immunologist Byram Bridle who claimed, just as spike proteins from the Covid-19 virus can enter the bloodstream and cause cellular damage, so can spike proteins generated by the Covid-19 vaccine. While we don’t know whether children produce more spike proteins following vaccination we recently fact checked Mr Bridle’s comments. Spike proteins generated by the vaccines work differently to those generated by the Covid-19 virus, and so the assumption that spike proteins generated by the vaccine could also harm cells in the bloodstream is unevidenced..  His theory has also been addressed by a number of other scientists and fact checkers.  HART also noted Newsround hadn’t mentioned some of the Pfizer vaccine's side effects, citing a recent FDA report and an upcoming U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emergency meeting on associated myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart, which can lead to heart failure). The CDC reported earlier this month that more than half of the myocarditis cases reported to the U.S Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System after the second dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines were in people aged between 12 and 24.  This has led to the FDA adding a warning to the Pfizer and Modera vaccines.  As noted earlier, the MHRA has received reports of myocarditis following vaccination but say instances are very rare, events were typically mild and individuals should still come forward for their vaccine unless advised not to.","https://www.hartgroup.org/bbc-newsround-vaccine/,https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/57389353,https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/57389353,https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2107456/suppl_file/nejmoa2107456_appendix.pdf#page=10,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210331005503/en/,https://fullfact.org/online/risk-children-death-covid/,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-19-in-children/,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-nhs-to-launch-long-covid-services-for-children-12332812,https://fullfact.org/online/Piers-Corbyn-wrong-covid-vaccine-figures/,https://fullfact.org/health/do-not-resuscitate-video/,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-57021738,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting,https://www.ukcolumn.org/community/forums/topic/dr-byram-bridle-assoc-prof-of-viral-immunology-latest-vaccine-research/,https://fullfact.org/online/conservative-woman-vaccine-scientist-spike-protein/,https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-vaccine-safe-idUSL2N2NX1J6,https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/byram-bridles-claim-that-covid-19-vaccines-are-toxic-fails-to-account-for-key-differences-between-the-spike-protein-produced-during-infection-and-vaccination-misrepresents-studies/,https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-377989296609,https://www.fda.gov/media/150054/download,https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/agenda-archive/agenda-2021-06-18-508.pdf,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/cdc-heart-inflammation-cases-ages-16-24-higher-than-expected-after-mrna-covid-19-2021-06-10/,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/953647,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/death-rate-statistics-Covid-19/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Critical report on BBC Newsround story is misleading,,,,,,

As we’ve covered many times before, the estimated Covid-19 survival rate has been estimated to be somewhere between 99-99.5%, though this has likely increased with the vaccine roll-out.  However, precise estimates are difficult to make because we don’t know the total number of people who caught Covid-19 and therefore what proportion survived. In any case, we can say the survival rate of the disease is lower than 99.98% because 0.2% of the population have already died with Covid-19 recorded as a cause on their death certificate, as this fact check explains. As we’ve said before the Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have all been tested on animals, as has the recently-approved Janssen vaccine. The confusion may have arisen from reports that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were permitted to carry out human trials concurrently with animal trials. The AstraZeneca vaccine was tested out on mice and monkeys before people. All of the vaccines required thorough assessment by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) before they were approved as safe for use. The MHRA continues to monitor the vaccines’ safety as well as any potential adverse effects.","https://www.instagram.com/p/CPTLjbnHz-G/?utm_source=ig_embed,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-19-survival-rate-less-998/,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-ifr-more-01/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-19-survival-rate-less-998/,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,https://perma.cc/MH8U-MJKF?type=image,https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-afs:Content:9792931264,https://www.understandinganimalresearch.org.uk/news/research-medical-benefits/how-effective-is-the-astrazenecaoxford-vaccine/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/death-rate-statistics-Covid-19/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Instagram post gets it wrong about Covid-19 vaccines and animal testing,,,,,,

26,,,,True,Sarah Turnnidge,2021-06-18,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-cremation-pcr-asymptomatic-transmission/,Covid-19 death statistics have been manipulated.,2021-06-18,fullfact,,"A widely-shared post on Facebook contains a number of inaccurate and misleading claims about the Covid-19 crisis, including claims about asymptomatic transmission, death statistics and cremation procedures.  We’ve checked five of the main ones.  The post claims that people who have died are being rapidly cremated, in some cases against their or their family’s wishes, due to the Coronavirus Act.  It is true that cremation form 5, a confirmatory medical certificate, has been suspended under the Coronavirus Act.  Before Covid-19, cremation form 5 was the second part of a formal procedure to authorise a cremation, designed as a safeguard. Two certificates needed to be signed, one by the registered medical practitioner who attended the deceased during their last illness, and the other—form 5—by a registered medical practitioner who is neither a partner nor a relative of the doctor who completed the first form. The first part of this process, cremation form 4 still applies, but any doctor can complete Form 4 as long as the deceased was seen by another doctor in the 28 days before death, or shortly after death.  Form 4 is still scrutinised by a crematorium medical referee, who has the power to halt a cremation if they are unsatisfied with the way in which a death has been registered. Form 5 was removed, the government guidance states, to simplify the process “in order to address the expected increased volume of deaths and the need to focus a reduced number of available medical practitioners on dealing with more priority cases, whilst keeping a necessary level of safeguards in place. “It is also intended to reduce the likelihood of delays to allowing families to be able to make cremation arrangements for the deceased.” It is untrue that this enables rapid cremation against the wishes of the deceased’s family. Government guidance to local authorities (who manage the deceased) specifically states that they have a legal obligation to consider the deceased's wishes, religion or beliefs where they are known. This should include “contacting and consulting their next of kin or family members to understand the deceased’s wishes”. In the early stages of the pandemic, when the Coronavirus Act 2020 was still at the bill stage and progressing through Parliament, there was some concern that powers granted by the act giving local authorities the power to choose between burial or cremation could lead to people being cremated against their or their family’s wishes.  However, the bill was amended as it passed through Parliament to include a specific clause stipulating that remains must be disposed of in accordance with the deceased’s wishes or in a manner that appears consistent with a person’s religion or beliefs, if known.  The post claims that asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 is “probably the biggest hoax ever inflicted on the public”. As we have written before, there is a significant body of evidence that not only does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 exist, it may account for a large proportion of cases of the virus.   One analysis published in the Lancet in January states that asymptomatic Covid-19 patients are infectious (although potentially less so than symptomatic patients). A meta-analysis of eight Chinese studies, published in the Journal of the American Medicine Association, says that transmission from asymptomatic individuals was estimated in some cases to have accounted for more than half of all Covid-19 transmissions. A review of 22 studies, published by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), estimated that the asymptomatic proportion of Covid-19 infections was 28%. The studies specifically differentiated between truly asymptomatic infections and pre-symptomatic infections, which are often conflated.  The author of the Facebook post also questions the reliability of PCR tests, describing them as “useless” and claiming that a high cycle threshold “gives rapidly increasing numbers of false positive results”.  Cycle thresholds have become a particular focus of misinformation during the pandemic, and we have written about them before.  A PCR test is performed by repeatedly replicating target viral material in the sample to the point that it becomes detectable. The number of cycles before the virus is detectable is known as the cycle threshold (Ct). A positive test with a high Ct value may indicate a test from someone who had a very small amount of detectable viral RNA on their initial swab, and therefore may not be infectious or have an ongoing active infection.  However, a positive test with a high Ct value may indicate someone who is still infectious, or who may soon become infectious. PCR tests aren’t perfect, but are generally seen as the gold standard for Covid-19 testing. The US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) says: “This test is typically highly accurate and usually does not need to be repeated.” The post claims that “most British labs used between 40 and 45 cycles” during 2020, and cites a Portuguese court ruling on PCR tests, in which judges described the reliability of the tests as “more than debatable” and said that “if a person has a positive PCR test at a cycle threshold of 35 or higher… the chances of a person being infected are less than 3%.”  According to Public Health England (PHE), a typical PCR test will go through a maximum of 40 thermal cycles, although some may go higher. PHE also says that, while a higher Ct value indicates a low concentration of viral genetic material and therefore a lower risk of infectivity, it could also represent a scenario where the risk of infectivity remains, for example, in early infection or where the sample was incorrectly collected.  It is inaccurate to say, as the post claims, that SAGE “had to admit to a mean false positive rate of 2.3% of all conducted tests”. The UK’s operational false positive rate is unknown.  This figure of 2.3% may come from a SAGE document, published in June 2020, in which an examination of 43 external quality assessments of PCR tests for other RNA viruses found a median false positivity rate of 2.3%.  We have written extensively about how Covid-19 deaths are counted throughout the pandemic. As of 17 June, 127,945 deaths have been recorded within 28 days of a positive Covid test in the UK. It is true, as the post claims, that this total may include some people who died for other reasons, besides Covid. However, it also does not include people who did die of Covid, but died more than 28 days after their first positive test, or people at the start of the pandemic who died of Covid but were not tested. Up to Friday 4 June, 2021, there have been 152,397 fatalities where Covid-19 was mentioned as a cause of death on the death certificate.  The World Health Organisation’s (WHO) guidelines on recording deaths from Covid-19, published in April 2020, states that, for surveillance purposes, a death from Covid-19 is defined as “a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed Covid-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to Covid disease (e.g. trauma)”. It does not, as the post claims, describe a “confirmed” Covid-19 death as any death following a positive test, even without symptoms of Covid-19. It is untrue that over 90% of Covid-19 deaths were in people who had one or more serious pre-existing conditions (or comorbidities, as the post states). Data compiled by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows that in England in 2020, 20.7% of Covid-19 deaths in those aged 64 and under and 11.6% of Covid-19 deaths in the over-65s were people who had no pre-existing conditions. In the first quarter of 2021, the most recent data we have, 13% of all people in England and Wales who died of Covid-19 had no pre-existing conditions.  The Facebook post also claims that the average age of death from Covid-19 is 82. This is about right.  The ONS does not publish information on the average age of Covid-19 deaths on a regular basis. However, a response to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request published in January 2021 shows that between the week ending 9 October, 2020, and the week ending January 1, 2021, the median age of deaths involving Covid-19 was 83.  Data published through a different FOI request to the ONS shows that the median age of Covid-19 deaths in England and Wales, up to and including 2 October, 2020, was also 83.  Even so, research suggests that people who die of Covid lose about a decade of life, on average. Claims that Covid-19 has a survival rate of approximately 99.8% have persisted throughout the pandemic and, as we have written before, this is untrue.  We can work this out simply by looking at the sheer number of people who have died. As of 17 June, 152,397 people have died with Covid-19 mentioned as a cause on their death certificate—about 0.23% of the entire UK population.  If only 0.2% of people die from Covid-19 after catching it (which the claimed 99.8% survival rate implies), then everyone in the country must have already been infected. This is almost certainly not the case.  Rising Covid-19 infection rates show that the virus is continuing to spread. This is very unlikely if everyone has already been infected.","https://www.facebook.com/chris.wakefield.31/posts/10219611813712568,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/confirm-details-of-the-cremation-medical-certificate,https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8860/,https://twitter.com/ilovepathology/status/1246727191179788288,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/878097/revised-guidance-to-crematorium-medical-referees.pdf#page=7,https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8860/,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/988273/Section_58_and_Schedule_28_to_the_Coronavirus_Act_2020.pdf#page=23,https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/coronavirus-powers-to-direct-between-burials-and-cremation/,https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/7/schedule/28/part/4/enacted,https://fullfact.org/online/david-icke-makes-false-claim-that-vaccines-are-gene-therapy/,https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/198833/whole-town-study-reveals-more-than-40/,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03141-3,https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/covid-19-what-proportion-are-asymptomatic/,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32651-9/fulltext,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774707,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/925128/S0745_Rapid_review_of_asymptomatic_proportion_of_SARS-CoV-2_infections_in_community_settings.pdf,https://fullfact.org/health/cycle-threshold-values/,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-pcr-test-accuracy/,https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/cclm/58/7/article-p1070.xml,https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/coronavirus-testing-basics,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t1b01H0Jd4hsMU7V1vy70yr8s3jlBedr/view?fbclid=IwAR0L_Iu6wwIVfFlZpykLhDHroS12MHZqO533Uizzc-5ZfUUmALOOjY58he4,https://www.portugalresident.com/judges-in-portugal-highlight-more-than-debatable-reliability-of-covid-tests/,https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&sl=pt&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dgsi.pt%2Fjtrl.nsf%2F33182fc732316039802565fa00497eec%2F79d6ba338dcbe5e28025861f003e7b30,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/926410/Understanding_Cycle_Threshold__Ct__in_SARS-CoV-2_RT-PCR_.pdf#page=6,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/926410/Understanding_Cycle_Threshold__Ct__in_SARS-CoV-2_RT-PCR_.pdf#page=3,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/895843/S0519_Impact_of_false_positives_and_negatives.pdf#page=2,https://fullfact.org/health/covid19-behind-the-death-toll/,https://fullfact.org/health/why-you-cant-compare-deaths-after-a-positive-covid-19-test-with-deaths-after-a-vaccine/,https://fullfact.org/health/liam-fox-death-figures/,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths,https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/Guidelines_Cause_of_Death_COVID-19.pdf,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/preexistingconditionsofpeoplewhodiedduetocovid19englandandwales,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/adhocs/12773averageageofdeathmedianandmeanofpersonswhosedeathwasduetocovid19orinvolvedcovid19bysexdeathsregisteredinweekending9october2020toweekending1january2021englandandwales,https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/freedomofinformationfoi/averageageofthosewhohaddiedwithcovid19,https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-75,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-19-survival-rate-less-998/,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/timeseries/ukpop/pop,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/death-rate-statistics-Covid-19/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Covid-19 victims cannot be cremated against their wishes,,,,,,

In the early stages of the pandemic, when the Coronavirus Act 2020 was still at the bill stage and progressing through Parliament, there was some concern that powers granted by the act giving local authorities the power to choose between burial or cremation could lead to people being cremated against their or their family’s wishes.  However, the bill was amended as it passed through Parliament to include a specific clause stipulating that remains must be disposed of in accordance with the deceased’s wishes or in a manner that appears consistent with a person’s religion or beliefs, if known.  The post claims that asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 is “probably the biggest hoax ever inflicted on the public”. As we have written before, there is a significant body of evidence that not only does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 exist, it may account for a large proportion of cases of the virus.   One analysis published in the Lancet in January states that asymptomatic Covid-19 patients are infectious (although potentially less so than symptomatic patients). A meta-analysis of eight Chinese studies, published in the Journal of the American Medicine Association, says that transmission from asymptomatic individuals was estimated in some cases to have accounted for more than half of all Covid-19 transmissions. A review of 22 studies, published by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), estimated that the asymptomatic proportion of Covid-19 infections was 28%. The studies specifically differentiated between truly asymptomatic infections and pre-symptomatic infections, which are often conflated.  The author of the Facebook post also questions the reliability of PCR tests, describing them as “useless” and claiming that a high cycle threshold “gives rapidly increasing numbers of false positive results”.  Cycle thresholds have become a particular focus of misinformation during the pandemic, and we have written about them before.  A PCR test is performed by repeatedly replicating target viral material in the sample to the point that it becomes detectable. The number of cycles before the virus is detectable is known as the cycle threshold (Ct). A positive test with a high Ct value may indicate a test from someone who had a very small amount of detectable viral RNA on their initial swab, and therefore may not be infectious or have an ongoing active infection.  However, a positive test with a high Ct value may indicate someone who is still infectious, or who may soon become infectious. PCR tests aren’t perfect, but are generally seen as the gold standard for Covid-19 testing. The US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) says: “This test is typically highly accurate and usually does not need to be repeated.” The post claims that “most British labs used between 40 and 45 cycles” during 2020, and cites a Portuguese court ruling on PCR tests, in which judges described the reliability of the tests as “more than debatable” and said that “if a person has a positive PCR test at a cycle threshold of 35 or higher… the chances of a person being infected are less than 3%.”  According to Public Health England (PHE), a typical PCR test will go through a maximum of 40 thermal cycles, although some may go higher. PHE also says that, while a higher Ct value indicates a low concentration of viral genetic material and therefore a lower risk of infectivity, it could also represent a scenario where the risk of infectivity remains, for example, in early infection or where the sample was incorrectly collected.  It is inaccurate to say, as the post claims, that SAGE “had to admit to a mean false positive rate of 2.3% of all conducted tests”. The UK’s operational false positive rate is unknown.  This figure of 2.3% may come from a SAGE document, published in June 2020, in which an examination of 43 external quality assessments of PCR tests for other RNA viruses found a median false positivity rate of 2.3%.  We have written extensively about how Covid-19 deaths are counted throughout the pandemic. As of 17 June, 127,945 deaths have been recorded within 28 days of a positive Covid test in the UK. It is true, as the post claims, that this total may include some people who died for other reasons, besides Covid. However, it also does not include people who did die of Covid, but died more than 28 days after their first positive test, or people at the start of the pandemic who died of Covid but were not tested. Up to Friday 4 June, 2021, there have been 152,397 fatalities where Covid-19 was mentioned as a cause of death on the death certificate.  The World Health Organisation’s (WHO) guidelines on recording deaths from Covid-19, published in April 2020, states that, for surveillance purposes, a death from Covid-19 is defined as “a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed Covid-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to Covid disease (e.g. trauma)”. It does not, as the post claims, describe a “confirmed” Covid-19 death as any death following a positive test, even without symptoms of Covid-19. It is untrue that over 90% of Covid-19 deaths were in people who had one or more serious pre-existing conditions (or comorbidities, as the post states). Data compiled by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows that in England in 2020, 20.7% of Covid-19 deaths in those aged 64 and under and 11.6% of Covid-19 deaths in the over-65s were people who had no pre-existing conditions. In the first quarter of 2021, the most recent data we have, 13% of all people in England and Wales who died of Covid-19 had no pre-existing conditions.  The Facebook post also claims that the average age of death from Covid-19 is 82. This is about right.  The ONS does not publish information on the average age of Covid-19 deaths on a regular basis. However, a response to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request published in January 2021 shows that between the week ending 9 October, 2020, and the week ending January 1, 2021, the median age of deaths involving Covid-19 was 83.  Data published through a different FOI request to the ONS shows that the median age of Covid-19 deaths in England and Wales, up to and including 2 October, 2020, was also 83.  Even so, research suggests that people who die of Covid lose about a decade of life, on average. Claims that Covid-19 has a survival rate of approximately 99.8% have persisted throughout the pandemic and, as we have written before, this is untrue.  We can work this out simply by looking at the sheer number of people who have died. As of 17 June, 152,397 people have died with Covid-19 mentioned as a cause on their death certificate—about 0.23% of the entire UK population.  If only 0.2% of people die from Covid-19 after catching it (which the claimed 99.8% survival rate implies), then everyone in the country must have already been infected. This is almost certainly not the case.  Rising Covid-19 infection rates show that the virus is continuing to spread. This is very unlikely if everyone has already been infected.","https://www.facebook.com/chris.wakefield.31/posts/10219611813712568,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/confirm-details-of-the-cremation-medical-certificate,https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8860/,https://twitter.com/ilovepathology/status/1246727191179788288,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/878097/revised-guidance-to-crematorium-medical-referees.pdf#page=7,https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8860/,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/988273/Section_58_and_Schedule_28_to_the_Coronavirus_Act_2020.pdf#page=23,https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/coronavirus-powers-to-direct-between-burials-and-cremation/,https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/7/schedule/28/part/4/enacted,https://fullfact.org/online/david-icke-makes-false-claim-that-vaccines-are-gene-therapy/,https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/198833/whole-town-study-reveals-more-than-40/,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03141-3,https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/covid-19-what-proportion-are-asymptomatic/,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32651-9/fulltext,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774707,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/925128/S0745_Rapid_review_of_asymptomatic_proportion_of_SARS-CoV-2_infections_in_community_settings.pdf,https://fullfact.org/health/cycle-threshold-values/,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-pcr-test-accuracy/,https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/cclm/58/7/article-p1070.xml,https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/coronavirus-testing-basics,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t1b01H0Jd4hsMU7V1vy70yr8s3jlBedr/view?fbclid=IwAR0L_Iu6wwIVfFlZpykLhDHroS12MHZqO533Uizzc-5ZfUUmALOOjY58he4,https://www.portugalresident.com/judges-in-portugal-highlight-more-than-debatable-reliability-of-covid-tests/,https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&sl=pt&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dgsi.pt%2Fjtrl.nsf%2F33182fc732316039802565fa00497eec%2F79d6ba338dcbe5e28025861f003e7b30,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/926410/Understanding_Cycle_Threshold__Ct__in_SARS-CoV-2_RT-PCR_.pdf#page=6,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/926410/Understanding_Cycle_Threshold__Ct__in_SARS-CoV-2_RT-PCR_.pdf#page=3,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/895843/S0519_Impact_of_false_positives_and_negatives.pdf#page=2,https://fullfact.org/health/covid19-behind-the-death-toll/,https://fullfact.org/health/why-you-cant-compare-deaths-after-a-positive-covid-19-test-with-deaths-after-a-vaccine/,https://fullfact.org/health/liam-fox-death-figures/,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths,https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/Guidelines_Cause_of_Death_COVID-19.pdf,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/preexistingconditionsofpeoplewhodiedduetocovid19englandandwales,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/adhocs/12773averageageofdeathmedianandmeanofpersonswhosedeathwasduetocovid19orinvolvedcovid19bysexdeathsregisteredinweekending9october2020toweekending1january2021englandandwales,https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/freedomofinformationfoi/averageageofthosewhohaddiedwithcovid19,https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-75,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-19-survival-rate-less-998/,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/timeseries/ukpop/pop,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/death-rate-statistics-Covid-19/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Covid-19 victims cannot be cremated against their wishes,,,,,,

Two certificates needed to be signed, one by the registered medical practitioner who attended the deceased during their last illness, and the other—form 5—by a registered medical practitioner who is neither a partner nor a relative of the doctor who completed the first form. The first part of this process, cremation form 4 still applies, but any doctor can complete Form 4 as long as the deceased was seen by another doctor in the 28 days before death, or shortly after death.  Form 4 is still scrutinised by a crematorium medical referee, who has the power to halt a cremation if they are unsatisfied with the way in which a death has been registered.

A positive test with a high Ct value may indicate a test from someone who had a very small amount of detectable viral RNA on their initial swab, and therefore may not be infectious or have an ongoing active infection.  However, a positive test with a high Ct value may indicate someone who is still infectious, or who may soon become infectious. PCR tests aren’t perfect, but are generally seen as the gold standard for Covid-19 testing. The US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) says: “This test is typically highly accurate and usually does not need to be repeated.” The post claims that “most British labs used between 40 and 45 cycles” during 2020, and cites a Portuguese court ruling on PCR tests, in which judges described the reliability of the tests as “more than debatable” and said that “if a person has a positive PCR test at a cycle threshold of 35 or higher… the chances of a person being infected are less than 3%.”  According to Public Health England (PHE), a typical PCR test will go through a maximum of 40 thermal cycles, although some may go higher. PHE also says that, while a higher Ct value indicates a low concentration of viral genetic material and therefore a lower risk of infectivity, it could also represent a scenario where the risk of infectivity remains, for example, in early infection or where the sample was incorrectly collected.  It is inaccurate to say, as the post claims, that SAGE “had to admit to a mean false positive rate of 2.3% of all conducted tests”. The UK’s operational false positive rate is unknown.  This figure of 2.3% may come from a SAGE document, published in June 2020, in which an examination of 43 external quality assessments of PCR tests for other RNA viruses found a median false positivity rate of 2.3%.  We have written extensively about how Covid-19 deaths are counted throughout the pandemic. As of 17 June, 127,945 deaths have been recorded within 28 days of a positive Covid test in the UK. It is true, as the post claims, that this total may include some people who died for other reasons, besides Covid. However, it also does not include people who did die of Covid, but died more than 28 days after their first positive test, or people at the start of the pandemic who died of Covid but were not tested. Up to Friday 4 June, 2021, there have been 152,397 fatalities where Covid-19 was mentioned as a cause of death on the death certificate.  The World Health Organisation’s (WHO) guidelines on recording deaths from Covid-19, published in April 2020, states that, for surveillance purposes, a death from Covid-19 is defined as “a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed Covid-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to Covid disease (e.g. trauma)”. It does not, as the post claims, describe a “confirmed” Covid-19 death as any death following a positive test, even without symptoms of Covid-19. It is untrue that over 90% of Covid-19 deaths were in people who had one or more serious pre-existing conditions (or comorbidities, as the post states). Data compiled by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows that in England in 2020, 20.7% of Covid-19 deaths in those aged 64 and under and 11.6% of Covid-19 deaths in the over-65s were people who had no pre-existing conditions. In the first quarter of 2021, the most recent data we have, 13% of all people in England and Wales who died of Covid-19 had no pre-existing conditions.  The Facebook post also claims that the average age of death from Covid-19 is 82. This is about right.  The ONS does not publish information on the average age of Covid-19 deaths on a regular basis. However, a response to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request published in January 2021 shows that between the week ending 9 October, 2020, and the week ending January 1, 2021, the median age of deaths involving Covid-19 was 83.  Data published through a different FOI request to the ONS shows that the median age of Covid-19 deaths in England and Wales, up to and including 2 October, 2020, was also 83.  Even so, research suggests that people who die of Covid lose about a decade of life, on average. Claims that Covid-19 has a survival rate of approximately 99.8% have persisted throughout the pandemic and, as we have written before, this is untrue.  We can work this out simply by looking at the sheer number of people who have died. As of 17 June, 152,397 people have died with Covid-19 mentioned as a cause on their death certificate—about 0.23% of the entire UK population.  If only 0.2% of people die from Covid-19 after catching it (which the claimed 99.8% survival rate implies), then everyone in the country must have already been infected. This is almost certainly not the case.  Rising Covid-19 infection rates show that the virus is continuing to spread. This is very unlikely if everyone has already been infected.","https://www.facebook.com/chris.wakefield.31/posts/10219611813712568,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/confirm-details-of-the-cremation-medical-certificate,https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8860/,https://twitter.com/ilovepathology/status/1246727191179788288,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/878097/revised-guidance-to-crematorium-medical-referees.pdf#page=7,https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8860/,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/988273/Section_58_and_Schedule_28_to_the_Coronavirus_Act_2020.pdf#page=23,https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/coronavirus-powers-to-direct-between-burials-and-cremation/,https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/7/schedule/28/part/4/enacted,https://fullfact.org/online/david-icke-makes-false-claim-that-vaccines-are-gene-therapy/,https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/198833/whole-town-study-reveals-more-than-40/,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03141-3,https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/covid-19-what-proportion-are-asymptomatic/,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32651-9/fulltext,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774707,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/925128/S0745_Rapid_review_of_asymptomatic_proportion_of_SARS-CoV-2_infections_in_community_settings.pdf,https://fullfact.org/health/cycle-threshold-values/,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-pcr-test-accuracy/,https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/cclm/58/7/article-p1070.xml,https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/coronavirus-testing-basics,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t1b01H0Jd4hsMU7V1vy70yr8s3jlBedr/view?fbclid=IwAR0L_Iu6wwIVfFlZpykLhDHroS12MHZqO533Uizzc-5ZfUUmALOOjY58he4,https://www.portugalresident.com/judges-in-portugal-highlight-more-than-debatable-reliability-of-covid-tests/,https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&sl=pt&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dgsi.pt%2Fjtrl.nsf%2F33182fc732316039802565fa00497eec%2F79d6ba338dcbe5e28025861f003e7b30,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/926410/Understanding_Cycle_Threshold__Ct__in_SARS-CoV-2_RT-PCR_.pdf#page=6,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/926410/Understanding_Cycle_Threshold__Ct__in_SARS-CoV-2_RT-PCR_.pdf#page=3,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/895843/S0519_Impact_of_false_positives_and_negatives.pdf#page=2,https://fullfact.org/health/covid19-behind-the-death-toll/,https://fullfact.org/health/why-you-cant-compare-deaths-after-a-positive-covid-19-test-with-deaths-after-a-vaccine/,https://fullfact.org/health/liam-fox-death-figures/,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths,https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/Guidelines_Cause_of_Death_COVID-19.pdf,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/preexistingconditionsofpeoplewhodiedduetocovid19englandandwales,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/adhocs/12773averageageofdeathmedianandmeanofpersonswhosedeathwasduetocovid19orinvolvedcovid19bysexdeathsregisteredinweekending9october2020toweekending1january2021englandandwales,https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/freedomofinformationfoi/averageageofthosewhohaddiedwithcovid19,https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-75,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-19-survival-rate-less-998/,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/timeseries/ukpop/pop,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/death-rate-statistics-Covid-19/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Covid-19 victims cannot be cremated against their wishes,,,,,,

33,,,,Other,Abbas Panjwani,2021-06-18,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/economy/april-2021-trade-figures/,"Imports from the rest of the world rose to £20.1 billion, their highest since records began in 1997.",2021-06-18,fullfact,,"A column in the Daily Express makes a number of claims about the latest trade data published by the Office for National Statistics.  A few of the claims could use more context.  The figures in the Express refer to the UK’s trade deficit (how much more we import than export), excluding precious metals, with the whole world in the three months to April 2021, not just the trade deficit with the EU. This data includes both trade in goods and services.  For April 2021, data on trade with the EU specifically is only available for goods, and not for services, so we don’t yet know the total trade deficit for the EU for April.  However, for goods only (excluding precious metals), it is correct that EU exports rose and EU imports fell in the three months to April 2021, compared to the three months to January 2021. It’s correct that exports from Britain to the EU, excluding precious metals, were valued at £12.9 billion in April 2021. As for the claim that exports were up 10% on pre-Brexit figures, the Express confirmed to Full Fact this was sourced from a Daily Telegraph article which looked at the change from the period “before pre-Brexit stockpiling began to skew figures at the end of last year.”  This refers to stockpiling which took place prior to the end of the transition period specifically rather than any other part of the Brexit process. Exports did increase 10% between July 2020 and April 2021, but, as the ONS notes, trade volumes are incredibly volatile at the moment and these figures don’t entirely represent the wider picture.  Exports fell considerably in spring 2020 as the pandemic took hold, before rebounding through the latter half of the year, partly influenced by stockpiling mentioned. They then fell again in January 2021, partly due to disruption associated with the end of the transition period, before rebounding again. Also, exports in April 2021 are down on the period before the pandemic started, and on the period before Brexit actually happened in January 2020. All but one month from January 2017 to the start of the pandemic saw the UK export more goods to the EU than in April 2021.  It’s correct that the UK is exporting more goods to non-EU countries (£13.6 billion excluding precious metals) than EU countries (£12.9 billion).  It’s also correct that the UK imported £20.1 billion of goods (excluding precious metals) from non-EU countries in April, which was technically the highest level recorded. But these figures represent cash values, and the value of money has decreased over time (inflation). Non-EU imports were higher during large periods of the late 2010s, once adjusted for inflation. Trade data can move quite a lot from month to month and as we’ve said is especially volatile given the effects of the pandemic, and the end of the transition period.  Therefore, it’s worth considering longer trends in trade data alongside month-to-month changes.  Since the mid-2010s the UK’s balance of trade (exports minus imports) for goods and services combined has grown, with the balance even turning positive for a few months, meaning we exported more than we imported.  There have been big swings in recent quarters, but, overall, it appears as if exports are catching up with imports.  Looking back over this period at trade with the EU specifically, the balance is negative (we import more than we export) and reached a low in 2019 after many years of going down, but did increase in 2020.

34,,,,Mixture,Leo Benedictus,2021-06-17,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/economy/uk-foreign-aid-g7/,The UK was the only G7 nation to reduce aid spending in 2020.,2021-06-17,fullfact,,"On Wednesday, opposition parties said the UK is the only country in the G7 to be reducing foreign aid. On Thursday, a New Statesman article said it was the only G7 country that had  reduced aid last year. Earlier in the week, a group of charities had released an open letter, in which they said that “While other G7 countries have stepped up their aid budget, the UK is the only one to have rowed back on its commitments."" Where 2020 is concerned, the claim by the New Statesman is potentially misleading. The supposed “cut” last year was extremely small—from 0.704% of national income to 0.698%—and the UK’s actual aid spending remained much higher than all other G7 countries, except Germany. The picture in 2021 is less clear, in part because we don’t yet know what any country’s total national income will be. The UK does plan a more substantial reduction this year—down to 0.5%—while most other G7 countries appear likely to raise their spending, at least on some measures. There are many different ways to measure how much a country spends on foreign aid. In cash terms, the US is the world’s biggest donor, but the US has a very large economy, so it also has more money to spend. Since 1970, many countries have endorsed a United Nations pledge to spend 0.7% of their Gross National Income (GNI) on aid each year. In practice, they have often failed to do so. The UK has spent almost exactly 0.7% of national income every year since 2013. However, it announced plans last November to reduce this to 0.5% from 2021. Spending 0.5% of national income on aid would be high by the UK’s historic standards, although it breaks a Conservative manifesto pledge and a legal commitment to maintain the level 0.7%. We have written another article that explains this in more detail. The New Statesman claimed in a headline, and on its “Chart of the Day” that “The UK was the only G7 member to cut foreign aid last year”.  This is true, but misleading, because it says nothing about the overall spending levels themselves.   In reality, even while the UK was observing the commitment to spend 0.7% of its income, it did not spend precisely this amount. In 2018, the exact figure was 0.696%; in 2019, it was 0.704%; in 2020, it was 0.698%. This tiny fall of 0.006 percentage points is what the New Statesman chart called a “cut” of $60 “per $1m of GNI”. So the claim is true, but it leaves out the larger picture: that the UK’s aid spending was essentially unchanged in 2020, making it the second-highest donor in the G7, and still spending more than twice as much as Japan, Italy, the US or Canada. The New Statesman did say later in the article: “Britain is also set to be overtaken by France, which last year spent 0.53 per cent, but it will remain ahead of Canada (0.31 per cent), Japan (0.31 per cent), Italy (0.22 per cent) and the US (0.17 per cent).” It is not yet possible to know how much these countries will spend on aid as a proportion of their national income this year. Some projections suggest it will be higher than these figures. The UK’s reduction in aid spending in 2021 will be much larger than it was in 2020. Mr Miliband and Mr Blackford also claimed that it would be the only G7 country reducing aid this year. This appears to be a reference to the planned reduction from 0.7% to 0.5%. When we asked them for the source of the claim that the UK was the only country, Mr Blackford’s office told us that it came from a New Statesman article, but did not specify which one. We can’t find a New Statesman article that makes this claim, and the chart that we’ve already mentioned was published the day after Mr Blackford’s comments, so it’s not quite clear what the source was. We have asked for more clarity on this. Mr Miliband’s office did not reply. Both politicians’ comments resemble a claim made by many charities, academics and universities in an open letter on 6 June, which said: “While other G7 countries have stepped up their aid budget, the UK is the only one to have rowed back on its commitments."" We spoke to Bond, a charity that organised the letter, which told us that this claim is based on the absolute spending on aid by each country. It also cited a research article from January, which says that at least four other G7 countries (France, Germany, Italy, Japan) plan to increase their absolute aid spending in 2021. We have not been able to find clear evidence that the US or Canada plan to raise absolute aid spending in 2021, although there are signs that the US may raise spending in 2022. An increase in absolute spending is also not necessarily an increase in a country’s share of income, if a country earns more in 2021 than it did in 2020. In short, there doesn’t seem to be enough evidence to support Mr MIliband’s or Mr Blackford’s comments, although it is plausible that they will turn out to be true when the evidence arrives.","https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2021/06/uk-was-only-g7-member-cut-foreign-aid-last-year,https://www.bond.org.uk/press-releases/2021/06/uks-words-risk-ringing-hollow-at-g7-unless-aid-cuts-are-reversed-warn,https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-data/ODA-2020-detailed-summary.pdf,https://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/the07odagnitarget-ahistory.htm,https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/Evolution%20of%20ODA.pdf#page=23,https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/Evolution%20of%20ODA.pdf#page=22,https://ifs.org.uk/uploads/BN322-The-UK%27s-reduction-in-aid-spending-2.pdf#page=7,https://ifs.org.uk/uploads/BN322-The-UK%27s-reduction-in-aid-spending-2.pdf#page=6,https://data.oecd.org/chart/6pc7,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/spending-review-2020-speech,https://fullfact.org/economy/foreign-aid-2021/,https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2021/06/uk-was-only-g7-member-cut-foreign-aid-last-year,https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-data/aid-at-a-glance.htm,https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-data/statisticsonresourceflowstodevelopingcountries.htm,https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-data/,https://donortracker.org/country/france,https://donortracker.org/country/italy,https://www.bond.org.uk/sites/default/files/20210605_letter_to_the_prime_minister_-_g7.pdf,https://www.cgdev.org/publication/overview-impact-proposed-cuts-uk-aid,https://www.devex.com/news/biden-proposes-6-8b-boost-for-us-international-budget-99627,https://fullfact.org/economy/george-freeman-africa-eu-tariffs/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/economy/millionaire-pensioners/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/economy/april-2021-trade-figures/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/economy/labours-record-on-unemployment/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/economy/foreign-aid-2021/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content","The UK will cut aid this year, but barely did last year",,,,,,
35,,,,False,Tom Norton,2021-06-14,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/online/david-icke-makes-false-claim-that-vaccines-are-gene-therapy/,Vaccine manufacturers have never claimed their vaccines stop transmission of Covid-19.,2021-06-14,fullfact,,"A video interview of conspiracy theorist David Icke, posted on Facebook, makes a number of misleading and dangerous claims about Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers, gene therapy and asymptomatic cases of the virus.  During the video, Mr Icke claims the transmission of Covid-19 through those with asymptomatic cases of the virus is a “hoax” and brands asymptomatic Covid-19 a “load of nonsense”. There is a large amount of evidence that asymptomatic cases not only exist but may have accounted for a huge proportion of total Covid-19 cases. One analysis published in the Lancet in January states that asymptomatic Covid-19 patients are infectious (although may be less so than symptomatic patients). It concluded that “where resources permit, contact tracing should proactively seek people with asymptomatic COVID-19 because they can transmit disease and will need to be contained if a national policy objective is to minimise cases and transmission.” Other analysis has been more forthright – a meta-analysis of eight Chinese studies, published in the Journal of the American Medicine Association, says that transmission from asymptomatic individuals was estimated in some cases to have accounted for more than half of all Covid-19 transmissions. Mr Icke also claims that Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum said Covid-19 was “an opportunity for a great reset to save the world from human caused climate change” and later states that Covid-19 and climate change are “two hoaxes perpetuated by the same force”.  The basis for this, he says, was a book by Mr Schwab and author Theirry Mallaret called “The Great Reset”. Since its publication in 2020 it has drawn the attention of conspiracy theorists.  The Great Reset (very broadly summarised) discusses how the world’s political, business and social institutions may wish to address pre-existing geo-political concerns, such as global warming, in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.  In the book Mr Schwab suggests the possibility of creating “long-lasting and wider environmental changes” through changes in behaviours and new activism as society readapts to a world in which it must co-exist with Covid-19. He also provides some evidence of some of the efforts being made by big business and others to achieve this.  However, Mr Schwab also states the pandemic has created significant risk that the climate change agenda could be deprioritised as nations attempt to deal with other pressures caused by the virus.  Mr Schwab states that some economies may even “put aside” concerns about global warming to concentrate on their recovery following Covid-19, which may well include subsidising “fossil-fuel heavy and carbon emitting industries”.  So while Mr Schwab did talk about climate change policy and action in respect of the global recovery from Covid-19, there is nothing to suggest the pandemic was engineered to promote this agenda. Mr Icke also suggests that none of the manufacturers of Covid-19 vaccines are “claiming to stop transmission”. Evidence shows vaccines reduce the risk of infection for those who have been vaccinated, and the risk of people who have been vaccinated from passing on the virus.  While manufacturers of Covid-19 vaccines have not claimed they prevent 100% of transmission, as they do not, evidence suggests the vaccines significantly reduce the risk. Evidence from Public Health England showed that the vaccine reduces the risk of infection by more than 70% which rises to 85% after two weeks.  Other studies have shown recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 95% less likely to contract Covid-19. For the Moderna vaccine that was 94% and for AstraZeneca it was 76%.  Initial research, covering over a million contacts in the UK, has found that people who became infected three weeks after their first vaccination were between 38% and 49% less likely to pass the virus onto household contacts. This protection appeared from around two weeks after the vaccination, and was regardless of age. We also have repeatedly written about the links between transmission of Covid-19 and vaccines. Mr Icke says plainly at one point that none of the Covid-19 vaccines fulfill the definition of a vaccine but that “they are a gene therapy”. Gene therapy is a technique to treat illnesses by modifying an individuals' genes, for example by replacing a faulty gene with a healthy one. As we have stated before, some of the Covid-19 vaccines contain messenger RNA (mRNA) that codes a protein specific to a pathogen’s surface. This mRNA provides instructions to make the proteins usually found on the surface of the Covid-19 virus. This in turn prompts the body to make Covid-19 antibodies.  However, introduction of mRNA into human cells does not change the DNA of the human cells and if these cells replicate, the mRNA would not be incorporated into the new cells’ genetic information. There are a number of other claims within the video which we’ve already debunked including false claims that that the inventor of PCR said it couldn’t be used to detect infectious diseases, that vaccines make you infertile and that the current Covid-19 vaccines don’t fulfil the definition of what a vaccine is.","https://www.facebook.com/OracleFilmsUK/videos/vb.110226437870353/505147480839056/?type=2&theater,https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/198833/whole-town-study-reveals-more-than-40/,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03141-3,https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/covid-19-what-proportion-are-asymptomatic/,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32651-9/fulltext,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774707,https://www.deseret.com/indepth/2021/1/2/22203108/great-reset-world-economic-forum-politics-conservative-conspiracy-parler-america-first,https://www.deseret.com/indepth/2021/1/2/22203108/great-reset-world-economic-forum-politics-conservative-conspiracy-parler-america-first,http://reparti.free.fr/schwab2020.pdf#page=60,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-real-world-uk-data-shows-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-provides-high-levels-of-protection-from-the-first-dose,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-covid-19-vaccine-moderna,https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/azd1222-us-phase-iii-primary-analysis-confirms-safety-and-efficacy.html,https://khub.net/documents/135939561/390853656/Impact+of+vaccination+on+household+transmission+of+SARS-COV-2+in+England.pdf/35bf4bb1-6ade-d3eb-a39e-9c9b25a8122a?t=1619601878136,https://fullfact.org/online/vaccine-infection-illness/,https://fullfact.org/online/this-morning-vaccines/,https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/cellular-gene-therapy-products/what-gene-therapy,https://fullfact.org/online/rna-vaccine-covid/,https://fullfact.org/online/pcr-test-mullis/,https://fullfact.org/online/Twickenham-Covid-19-vaccine-claims-false/,https://fullfact.org/online/Twickenham-Covid-19-vaccine-claims-false/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/death-rate-statistics-Covid-19/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",David Icke makes false claim that vaccines are ‘gene therapy’,,,,,,

Mr Icke also claims that Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum said Covid-19 was “an opportunity for a great reset to save the world from human caused climate change” and later states that Covid-19 and climate change are “two hoaxes perpetuated by the same force”.  The basis for this, he says, was a book by Mr Schwab and author Theirry Mallaret called “The Great Reset”. Since its publication in 2020 it has drawn the attention of conspiracy theorists.  The Great Reset (very broadly summarised) discusses how the world’s political, business and social institutions may wish to address pre-existing geo-political concerns, such as global warming, in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.  In the book Mr Schwab suggests the possibility of creating “long-lasting and wider environmental changes” through changes in behaviours and new activism as society readapts to a world in which it must co-exist with Covid-19. He also provides some evidence of some of the efforts being made by big business and others to achieve this.  However, Mr Schwab also states the pandemic has created significant risk that the climate change agenda could be deprioritised as nations attempt to deal with other pressures caused by the virus.  Mr Schwab states that some economies may even “put aside” concerns about global warming to concentrate on their recovery following Covid-19, which may well include subsidising “fossil-fuel heavy and carbon emitting industries”.  So while Mr Schwab did talk about climate change policy and action in respect of the global recovery from Covid-19, there is nothing to suggest the pandemic was engineered to promote this agenda. Mr Icke also suggests that none of the manufacturers of Covid-19 vaccines are “claiming to stop transmission”. Evidence shows vaccines reduce the risk of infection for those who have been vaccinated, and the risk of people who have been vaccinated from passing on the virus.  While manufacturers of Covid-19 vaccines have not claimed they prevent 100% of transmission, as they do not, evidence suggests the vaccines significantly reduce the risk. Evidence from Public Health England showed that the vaccine reduces the risk of infection by more than 70% which rises to 85% after two weeks.  Other studies have shown recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 95% less likely to contract Covid-19. For the Moderna vaccine that was 94% and for AstraZeneca it was 76%.  Initial research, covering over a million contacts in the UK, has found that people who became infected three weeks after their first vaccination were between 38% and 49% less likely to pass the virus onto household contacts. This protection appeared from around two weeks after the vaccination, and was regardless of age. We also have repeatedly written about the links between transmission of Covid-19 and vaccines. Mr Icke says plainly at one point that none of the Covid-19 vaccines fulfill the definition of a vaccine but that “they are a gene therapy”. Gene therapy is a technique to treat illnesses by modifying an individuals' genes, for example by replacing a faulty gene with a healthy one. As we have stated before, some of the Covid-19 vaccines contain messenger RNA (mRNA) that codes a protein specific to a pathogen’s surface. This mRNA provides instructions to make the proteins usually found on the surface of the Covid-19 virus. This in turn prompts the body to make Covid-19 antibodies.  However, introduction of mRNA into human cells does not change the DNA of the human cells and if these cells replicate, the mRNA would not be incorporated into the new cells’ genetic information. There are a number of other claims within the video which we’ve already debunked including false claims that that the inventor of PCR said it couldn’t be used to detect infectious diseases, that vaccines make you infertile and that the current Covid-19 vaccines don’t fulfil the definition of what a vaccine is.","https://www.facebook.com/OracleFilmsUK/videos/vb.110226437870353/505147480839056/?type=2&theater,https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/198833/whole-town-study-reveals-more-than-40/,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03141-3,https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/covid-19-what-proportion-are-asymptomatic/,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32651-9/fulltext,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774707,https://www.deseret.com/indepth/2021/1/2/22203108/great-reset-world-economic-forum-politics-conservative-conspiracy-parler-america-first,https://www.deseret.com/indepth/2021/1/2/22203108/great-reset-world-economic-forum-politics-conservative-conspiracy-parler-america-first,http://reparti.free.fr/schwab2020.pdf#page=60,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-real-world-uk-data-shows-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-provides-high-levels-of-protection-from-the-first-dose,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-covid-19-vaccine-moderna,https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/azd1222-us-phase-iii-primary-analysis-confirms-safety-and-efficacy.html,https://khub.net/documents/135939561/390853656/Impact+of+vaccination+on+household+transmission+of+SARS-COV-2+in+England.pdf/35bf4bb1-6ade-d3eb-a39e-9c9b25a8122a?t=1619601878136,https://fullfact.org/online/vaccine-infection-illness/,https://fullfact.org/online/this-morning-vaccines/,https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/cellular-gene-therapy-products/what-gene-therapy,https://fullfact.org/online/rna-vaccine-covid/,https://fullfact.org/online/pcr-test-mullis/,https://fullfact.org/online/Twickenham-Covid-19-vaccine-claims-false/,https://fullfact.org/online/Twickenham-Covid-19-vaccine-claims-false/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/death-rate-statistics-Covid-19/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",David Icke makes false claim that vaccines are ‘gene therapy’,,,,,,

38,,,,Other,Daniella de Block Golding,2021-06-11,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/online/david-icke-midazolam/,There's no evidence there is a Covid-19 virus. The illusion of it has been manifested by using a fake test and fraudulent death certificates.,2021-06-11,fullfact,,"Conspiracy theorist David Icke has released a long  video that has been shared on social media, talking about the use of a drug called midazolam during the Covid-19 pandemic. He claims that midazolam was used to facilitate the “culling of old people”, and that Covid-19 is a faked pandemic used as a guise to allow this.  He also claims that tests for Covid-19 are “fake” and death certificates issued during the pandemic are fraudulent.  There is no evidence for any of these claims. Covid-19 is the disease caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus. We have written many times before about the Covid-19 pandemic, and the evidence behind proof of its existence. It has been isolated many times, been recognised worldwide and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation in March 2020. We also know that tests for Covid-19 are largely accurate. We have written more about tests for Covid-19 previously.  There has been some controversy around the way that deaths from Covid-19 have been recorded. Sometimes death tolls count anybody who has died within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19. Others, however, only include deaths which have Covid-19 recorded as the cause of death on the death certificate by a doctor (the government’s Covid-19 dashboard includes both of these tolls).  Up until the week ending 28 May 2021, the Office for National Statistics data shows there have been 138,367 deaths in England and Wales involving Covid-19 (where Covid-19 is mentioned anywhere on the death certificate), and 123,717 with Covid-19 documented as the underlying cause of death on the death certificate. As of April 2021, there were approximately 42,341 deaths of care home residents involving Covid-19 in England and Wales. This is an approximate figure, as testing availability in the community was variable, particularly during the first wave.  Midazolam is a type of benzodiazepine medication, used as a conscious sedative, anaesthetic agent, anticonvulsant and is also licensed to help manage restlessness and agitation in palliative care.  Midazolam is often prescribed as an ‘anticipatory medication’. These are medications that are prescribed in advance for patients who are nearing the end of life should they experience any common and unpleasant symptoms such as anxiety, pain, nausea and vomiting associated with the dying process. They do not necessarily have to be used, and should be given ‘as required’.  Midazolam can also be used more generally for patients who are not nearing end of life, and for sedation for certain medical procedures.  There is no evidence that midazolam was being used with the intention of ending care home residents’ lives, or that this was a formal policy.  The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) told Full Fact: “These claims are deeply misleading. The government’s top priority throughout this pandemic has always been doing everything possible to save lives.” Euthanasia remains illegal in the UK.  During the Covid-19 pandemic, the government did stockpile certain medications, including midazolam.  DHSC told Full Fact: “COVID-19 has brought about an increase in global and UK demand for a number of medicines, including midazolam to support patients in intensive care or at the end of their lives.” In his video post, Mr Icke says that the UK supplemented stocks by getting midazolam from France. A DHSC spokesperson previously told Full Fact that: “To manage increases in demand, we have been building UK stockpiles of key medicines, including midazolam. “All of the Midazolam purchased for the UK Covid-19 medicines stockpile was sourced within the UK, has been licensed for use in the UK and was destined for the UK market.” There has been some confusion around where the stock came from, as an article published in the Pharmaceutical Journal in May 2020, in which the DHSC reportedly confirmed that “some French label stock” of midazolam was being sold in the UK. It is unclear whether this stock had already reached France or had been produced and held in the UK. We have written more about this previously.  In the video, Mr Icke suggests that the use of midazolam, and practices around end of life care are a return to the Liverpool Care Pathway, which was abolished in 2014.  The Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP) was a generic approach to care for the dying, intended to improve end of life care and allow some of the essentials of palliative medicine and hospice model end of life practices into hospitals and other healthcare settings.  It became controversial and was criticised by patient and family groups, media and by some medical professionals who referenced cases where individuals had been ‘put on’ the pathway without consent or discussion and where the pathway had been used as an excuse for depersonalised and substandard care. Complaints included anger around medications being stopped, patients not being offered food and drink, or being inappropriately identified as dying. There were also criticisms that the use of the LCP had hastened people’s deaths through over-prescription of painkillers and/or the withdrawal of hydration or nutrition.  This led to an independent review in 2013, which concluded that although the principles behind the LCP could promote good practice and prevent suffering at the end of life, there had been failings. It was recommended that the LCP be replaced by an individualised end of life care plan for each patient. The review also recommended structural change, education, planning and inspection around end of life care.  Therefore, while midazolam was included as a symptom control option in the LCP, its use has continued as a tenet of good end of life care.  There is no evidence that the LCP has been reinstated. DHSC confirmed that it is not aware of any trusts using the LCP since it was phased out, and NHS England is clear that the LCP must not be used.","https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1053552418504543,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-isolated-virus/,https://fullfact.org/health/antivax-video-march-2021/,https://fullfact.org/online/coronavirus-textbook-1989-common-cold/,https://fullfact.org/health/colds-flu-second-wave/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-19-is-not-flu/,https://fullfact.org/health/antivax-video-march-2021/,https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020,https://fullfact.org/online/screenshot-false-positive-rate-viruses-exist/,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-pcr-test-accuracy/,https://fullfact.org/health/cycle-threshold-values/,https://fullfact.org/health/lateral-flow/,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19/latestinsights#deaths,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/latest,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/latest,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/deathsinvolvingcovid19inthecaresectorenglandandwales/deathsregisteredbetweenweekending20march2020andweekending2april2021,https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drug/midazolam.html,https://www.mariecurie.org.uk/professionals/palliative-care-knowledge-zone/symptom-control/anticipatory-medicines,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/euthanasia-and-assisted-suicide/,https://pharmaceutical-journal.com/article/news/supplies-of-sedative-used-for-covid-19-patients-diverted-from-france-to-avoid-potential-shortages,https://fullfact.org/online/viral-video-covid-vaccine/,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/212450/Liverpool_Care_Pathway.pdf#page=6,https://www.mariecurie.org.uk/media/press-releases/marie-curie-welcomes-recommendations-of-liverpool-care-pathway-review/103369,https://www.nursingtimes.net/clinical-archive/end-of-life-and-palliative-care/what-is-the-liverpool-care-pathway-08-11-2012/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5963294/pdf/wellcomeopenres-3-15857.pdf,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/212450/Liverpool_Care_Pathway.pdf#page=3,https://www.nursingtimes.net/clinical-archive/end-of-life-and-palliative-care/what-is-the-liverpool-care-pathway-08-11-2012/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5963294/pdf/wellcomeopenres-3-15857.pdf,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/212450/Liverpool_Care_Pathway.pdf#page=4,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2364029/How-Liverpool-Care-Pathway-used-excuse-appalling-care.html,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2223286/Hospitals-bribed-patients-pathway-death-Cash-incentive-NHS-trusts-meet-targets-Liverpool-Care-Pathway.html,https://www.compassionindying.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IN05-What-happened-to-the-Liverpool-Care-Pathway.pdf#page=1,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/212450/Liverpool_Care_Pathway.pdf,https://www.palliativedrugs.com/download/08_06_LCP_renalprescribing.pdf%60#page=7,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/death-rate-statistics-Covid-19/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Covid-19 is real and not a government euthanasia policy,,,,,,
39,,,,True,Leo Benedictus,2021-06-10,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/economy/foreign-aid-2021/,The present government has spent more on foreign aid than any previous Labour government.,2021-06-10,fullfact,,"On Wednesday, the Prime Minister said that this government has spent more on aid than Labour governments did in the past. He also said that the government was continuing to spend more—even with its planned reduction of the aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income. This is essentially true, with some minor caveats. Since the late 2000s, the UK has spent much more on foreign aid than it used to—both in terms of cash, and as a share of the national income. So the Conservative-led governments since 2010 have certainly spent more on aid than any previous Labour government, and more than any previous Conservative government too. This partly reflects the UK’s commitment, along with many other countries, to the United Nations target of spending 0.7% of national income on foreign aid every year. In practice, countries often do not live up to this.The UK has met the 0.7% aid target every year since 2013, however, and in 2015 the Conservative-led coalition government made doing so a legal requirement. This usually means spending more on aid each year, as the national income grows, but in 2020 it’s expected to mean spending less in cash terms, because the national income fell during the pandemic. Maintaining the 0.7% commitment was also a pledge in the Conservatives’ 2019 general election manifesto. In November 2020, however, the government announced that it would reduce the target to 0.5% for a period, while finances recover from the pandemic. “Our intention is to return to 0.7% when the fiscal situation allows,” the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said. The new target will substantially reduce the amount of aid spending. Although even at 0.5% of national income, it will be higher than it generally was before 2006. Mr Johnson’s claim that “we continue to spend more than Labour ever did” is therefore accurate if you compare sustained periods of government—although Labour did spend 0.51% of national income on foreign aid in two single years: 2006 and 2009.","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/spending-review-2020-speech,https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/statistics-on-international-development-final-uk-aid-spend-2019,https://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/the07odagnitarget-ahistory.htm,https://ifs.org.uk/uploads/BN322-The-UK%27s-reduction-in-aid-spending-2.pdf#page=7,https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn03714/,https://assets-global.website-files.com/5da42e2cae7ebd3f8bde353c/5dda924905da587992a064ba_Conservative%202019%20Manifesto.pdf#page=55,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/spending-review-2020-speech,https://fullfact.org/economy/george-freeman-africa-eu-tariffs/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/economy/millionaire-pensioners/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/economy/april-2021-trade-figures/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/economy/uk-foreign-aid-g7/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/economy/labours-record-on-unemployment/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Boris Johnson was broadly right about aid spending,,,,,,

Using the latest statistics when the statement was posted, there were 246,970 adverse reaction reports made to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), among which there were 857,323 suspected reactions (a single report may contain more than one symptom).  However, as we have stated before, while the Yellow Card scheme records reported adverse reactions following vaccination, it does not mean the vaccines are necessarily the cause of  these reactions.  While the MHRA monitors the effects of the vaccines, it has noted the number and nature of Yellow Card reports is “not unusual for a new vaccine for which members of the public and healthcare professionals are encouraged to report any suspected adverse reaction.” The MHRA notes that the “overwhelming majority” of these reports are of injection site reactions that are “not associated with more serious or lasting illness” which “reflect the acute immune response triggered by the body to the vaccines, are typically seen with most types of vaccine and tend to resolve within a day or two.” Out of the 857,323 suspected reactions, 1,400 include more serious potential side effects such as anaphylaxis, blood clots and capillary leak syndrome (a rare but potentially fatal condition where blood leaks from the small blood vessels into the body). Again, this does not mean that the vaccine caused them. There have been 1,213 reported deaths within seven days of vaccination. Although Mr Corbyn gave the correct number, he was wrong to say these were all caused by the vaccines. The MHRA’s report states: “The majority of these reports were in elderly people or people with underlying illness.” The MHRA states that individual reviews have (so far) found no link between these deaths and the vaccine.  Mr Corbyn also claimed people are more likely to die from Covid-19 vaccines than from Covid-19. This is clearly untrue, as at least 123,647 people have already died of Covid in England and Wales so far. Even if everyone in England and Wales had been infected with Covid, this would still make it much more dangerous than vaccination.  Mr Corbyn claims in his post there is a 99.97% survival rate for Covid-19. We’ve written before about how European estimates (i.e. estimates in countries with similar age profiles and healthcare quality as the UK) put the fatality rate at somewhere between 0.5% and 1%, meaning the “survival rate” could be somewhere between 99% and 99.5%. But precise estimates for the UK are difficult to make, because we don’t know how many people have caught Covid, and therefore what proportion have survived.","https://www.facebook.com/stopnewnormaluk/posts/297520508757540,https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/the-yellow-card-scheme/,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/989946/Coronavirus_vaccine_-_summary_of_Yellow_Card_reporting_19.05.21.pdf,https://fullfact.org/online/yellow-card-astrazeneca-reactions/,https://fullfact.org/online/460-vaccine-deaths-yellow-card/,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/991132/Coronavirus_vaccine_-_summary_of_Yellow_Card_reporting_26_05.pdf#page=14,https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1399/fig2/datadownload.xlsx,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-ifr-more-01/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/death-rate-statistics-Covid-19/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Piers Corbyn makes misleading claims about vaccine deaths,,,,,,

Full Fact readers have asked us whether the poster is genuine, but it is not.   The poster talks about the importance of the Yellow Card scheme, which is the UK system for collecting reports of safety concerns such as potential side effects involving medical devices and medicines, including vaccines.   It claims that Yellow Card reports are essential to ensure the Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective and will enable the vaccines to move out of phase 3 clinical trials and be granted “full approval”.  However, these claims are not entirely true. The poster is a pretty good imitation of similar graphics published by the MHRA but there are still some clues which suggest that it might not be genuine. Doing a Google image search for “MHRA Coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine injury report scheme” returned very similar graphics to the fake one. These images led to a legitimate MHRA webpage which linked to various resources for its “Every report counts campaign”, including posters. However, none of the posters or images there matched the image we’re checking.  And while the style was quite similar (using the same graphics of people and colour scheme), there were some key differences.  The real posters use a slightly different typeface and the MHRA’s logo looks different in the fabricated poster. There is also a grammatical error in the fake poster.   The MHRA confirmed to Full Fact that the image on social media did not come from them. The claims made in the fake poster are also not entirely accurate. It is true that the MHRA has launched a campaign promoting the Yellow Card scheme, and it is important people report suspected side effects from vaccines so they can be investigated. But the fake poster then says: “This [data] will allow [the vaccines] to move out of the phase 3 clinical trials and be granted full approval by the European Medical Agency as it currently only has temporary approval by the MHRA.” This doesn’t accurately represent how vaccine approval works nor the place of Yellow Card reports in the process.  Vaccines, like other drugs, go through a number of stages before being released.  Before human trials, vaccines must be shown to be safe and effective in animals. Then, phase 1 trials among up to 100 adults are focused on making sure the vaccine has no major safety concerns, and to work out the most effective dose. Phase 2 trials involve a few hundred participants and are more focused on checking the vaccine works consistently, and starting to look for any side effects. Phase 3 trials are then conducted among, typically, thousands of participants and are used to gather statistically significant and robust data on a vaccine’s safety and efficacy.  Following phase 3, the vaccine manufacturer can submit all their data to the regulatory body (which in the UK is the MHRA) which will then decide whether to licence the vaccine. The four Covid-19 vaccines approved for use in the UK (Oxford-AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen) have all published data from their phase 3 trials demonstrating they are safe and effective. Participants in these trials are being monitored for the next few years, but it’s wrong to suggest that Yellow Card reports are needed for the vaccines to “move out of the phase 3 clinical trials.”  It is also wrong to suggest, as some on social media have done, that because these trials are ongoing, people who take the vaccines are themselves in clinical trials. Some drugs also go through trials after being fully rolled out, known as phase 4 trials, which don’t mean that people regularly prescribed them are in clinical trials themselves.  Analysis of the Yellow Card reports so far shows that, other than well-known, temporary, mild and moderate side effects, such as fatigue, the risk of serious illness is very low. One possible link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and a rare blood clot has been identified. The latest data shows around one in 400,000 people who have been given a dose of the vaccine have died of one of these blood clots in the UK.  The poster claims the vaccines have received “temporary approval” which is essentially correct.  The Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have received temporary authorisation via regulation 174 of the Human Medicines Regulation 2012, while the Moderna and Janssen vaccines have received “conditional marketing authorisation”, a type of licence.  We’ve written about the different types of authorisation for vaccines before.  Normally, vaccines go through a process to obtain marketing authorisation (also known as a licence). In certain scenarios, however, for example in response to “pathogenic agents”, the MHRA may use different types of authorisation. Regulation 174 temporary authorisations are triggered by the government, rather than applied for by the drug company, and authorise the emergency supply of an unlicensed medicine in response to an unmet public health need. The process doesn’t allow them to be turned into full permanent licenses, although that doesn’t stop Pfizer or AstraZeneca applying for a license for their vaccines in the future. A conditional marketing authorisation, as held by Moderna and Janssen for their Covid vaccines, is applied for by the company in question. It is also a form of temporary authorisation, but can be converted into a full, permanent marketing authorisation, or licence.   The MHRA has previously told Full Fact that temporary authorisation and conditional marketing authorisations are “regulatory tools that enable medicines to be approved at the earliest time possible during an emergency situation, as soon as there are robust data to show that the benefits outweigh the risks” and added that no vaccine would be authorised in this way “unless the expected high standards are met”.","https://twitter.com/BluesManV2/status/1398551917840711685,https://www.facebook.com/ANHInternational/photos/a.867511463290190/5491771804197443,https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/the-yellow-card-scheme/,https://www.google.com/search?q=MHRA+Coronavirus+(Covid-19)+vaccine+injury+report+scheme&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiNgsWEsfvwAhWzDWMBHd72DaYQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&biw=1536&bih=722#imgrc=A5obLUBDLxp27M,https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/,https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/campaignpage,https://downloads.ctfassets.net/58vt0wp5xpi9/1cq6VCa1c0MwC7uXmAtF2N/b6a4b3853a9362b475017cf225628ed6/A4_Poster_EveryReportCounts-1-.pdf,https://images.ctfassets.net/58vt0wp5xpi9/7p797fj8tVdb7aXCHbhjGw/2d85aecf0c19caa879531effb26583fd/Email_Signature_Version-1_ERC-1-.png,https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/campaignpage,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/vaccine-development,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32661-1/fulltext,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2035389,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2101544,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04516746?term=NCT04516746&draw=2&rank=1,https://twitter.com/BluesManV2/status/1398551917840711685,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/vaccine-development,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting#analysis-of-data,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/information-for-uk-recipients-on-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca/information-for-uk-recipients-on-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca,https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/1916/regulation/174/made,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna/summary-of-the-public-assessment-report-for-covid-19-vaccine-moderna,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-janssen,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-vaccines/,https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/1916/made/data.pdf#page=35,https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/access-to-treatment/how-are-drugs-licensed-in-the-uk,https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/access-to-treatment/how-are-drugs-licensed-in-the-uk,https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/1916/regulation/174/made,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-vaccines/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/death-rate-statistics-Covid-19/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Poster about Yellow Card scheme is not real,,,,,,

Not only have we repeatedly debunked claims that Covid-19 vaccines are “devices”, but all four vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, Astra-Zeneca, Janssen) are authorised as vaccines by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). It’s not clear what is meant by an “immune response” which would lead to your body attacking itself. There is no evidence that the currently approved Covid-19 vaccines cause autoimmune diseases or other autoimmune responses.  We have previously debunked claims that the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine causes infertility in women (Professor Jonathan Stoye, Virologist at the Francis Crick Institute, told Full Fact the possibility of a risk is “vanishingly small”) and they risk causing infertility in young men (evidence shows the vaccine may help protect male fertility). Many other news outlets, fact checkers and health businesses have also dispelled claims that Covid-19 vaccines cause infertility. Covid-19 vaccines do not contain micro-transmitters of any kind. While the Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines do use nanoparticles, this is just a generic term for very small particles that can be found in nature or can be man-made. These however are not “nanobots”. They don’t send data and cannot connect to WiFi. Nanoparticles have been used to deliver medicines into the body since the 1990s. In another section of the video, one of the protestors says over the microphone: This is wrong for several reasons. Firstly, the British Red Cross is not responsible for managing blood donations in England, it’s NHS Blood and Transplant. Secondly, you can give blood after having a vaccine. However, in England, you have to wait seven days from your vaccination or, if you experience side effects, 28 days after recovery from those side effects.

47,,,,False,Abbas Panjwani,2021-06-03,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/education/literacy-numeracy-uk-telegraph/,The UK has the lowest literacy rates in its history,2021-06-03,fullfact,,"A column in the Daily Telegraph makes a number of eye-catching claims about the state of education in the UK, but not all of them are right.  In the piece, journalist Celia Walden argues that schemes to help pupils catch up on their learning after the pandemic should focus on the core education of literacy and numeracy. She writes: “Do we really need reminding that […] we have the lowest literacy rates in our history.” This isn’t true. We’ve asked the Telegraph what Ms Walden was referring to but it has not responded. Our World in Data, a statistical publication from the University of Oxford, has collated figures going back to 1475, showing literacy in the late 15th century was around 5% - meaning only 5% of the population could read and write.  It is currently around 99%, although a significant number have low levels of literacy. Assuming that Ms Walden was referring to the more recent past, it also appears as if this has improved slightly over the past few decades, based on the little consistent data available.  The average adult literacy scores improved between 1996 and 2012. And England’s score in international tests among children shows reading aptitude has remained similar or even increased since 2006.   The Telegraph article goes on to claim: “Our child literacy and numeracy rates consistently languish either at or near the bottom of every international table.”  We have asked the Telegraph for the source of this claim. It possibly refers to a 2012 analysis by the OECD which found that England had the highest proportion of teenagers aged 16-19 with low levels of literacy and numeracy among 23 countries and territories. However, it would be wrong to say that the UK’s child literacy and numeracy rates are at or near the bottom of every international table. More recent data, albeit covering children of different ages, paints a more positive picture.  In 2016, the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) tested 10-year-olds across 50 countries and territories. Northern Ireland placed seventh and England placed joint-eighth, while Scotland and Wales did not participate. In 2018, the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) tested 15-year-olds across around 80 countries and territories and the UK was above average for both reading and mathematics.

48,,,,Other,Grace Rahman,2021-06-01,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/online/this-morning-vaccines/,The survival rate from Covid-19 is 99.8%.,2021-06-01,fullfact,,"A heated exchange between presenter Dermot O’Leary and guest Beverley Turner on This Morning, about whether the Covid-19 vaccines stop you from catching and passing on the disease has gone viral on social media.  Ms Turner claimed: “[The vaccine] does not stop you contracting or passing on the virus.” Multiple, reliable forms of evidence show that vaccines greatly reduce a person’s chance of contracting or passing on a virus. Ms Turner has asked us to clarify that she meant that the vaccines don’t always stop the transmission of the disease, which is correct as set out below. The NHS website says that the vaccines reduce your risk of catching, spreading, getting symptoms, getting ill, and dying from Covid, and she has asked us to clarify that her remarks about transmission were intended to reflect that. Studies have found that people given one dose of the Pfizer vaccine have a 70% reduced risk of becoming infected, both with and without symptoms, rising to 85% after the second dose. This data comes from testing healthcare workers who were tested for Covid every two weeks, regardless of whether they had symptoms. Data in adults over 70 shows that both the Pfizer and the AstraZeneca vaccines are between 60-70% effective against symptomatic disease around a month after the first dose, and 85-90% after the second dose of Pfizer (this particular study didn’t look at the effect after two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine). As to Ms Turner’s claim on vaccines not stopping people passing on the virus, the evidence suggests that one dose of either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccines significantly reduces your chances of passing on the virus to members of your household, if you do catch it. Initial research, covering over a million contacts in the UK, has found that people who became infected three weeks after their first vaccination were between 38% and 49% less likely to pass the virus onto household contacts. This protection appeared from around two weeks after the vaccination, and was regardless of age. This may be what Ms Turner was referring to when she then went on to say there was “a little bit of evidence to suggest that it might minimise transmission, but that’s because it ameliorates your symptoms and if it ameliorates your symptoms then you are less likely to pass it on.” She also made a number of other claims about the Covid survival rate and whether the vaccine is in trials that we have written about before. Ms Turner described the Covid-19 vaccine as a “trial drug”. While it’s not quite clear what this means, we have checked similar claims before. These claims have been based on the fact that some of the Covid-19 vaccine trials have completion dates set in the future. As we’ve explained before, data on key safety and efficacy outcomes has already been published in peer-reviewed journals, but data on long term protection and safety will continue to be collected over the coming years.  The three coronavirus vaccines currently approved and being rolled out in the UK have been through all the normal stages of vaccine testing, including animal and human studies. The survival rate is almost certainly lower than this in the UK, as we’ve written before.  We’ve covered elsewhere how  estimates for Europe (countries with similar age profiles and healthcare quality as the UK) put the fatality rate at somewhere between 0.5% and 1%, meaning the “survival rate” could be somewhere between 99% and 99.5%, but not as high as 99.8%. Covid-19 is more dangerous in older populations, which is part of the reason survival rates vary between countries. As of 14 May there have been about 153,000 deaths registered with Covid-19 recorded as a cause on the death certificate. That’s about 0.23% of the entire UK population. If the survival rate really was 99.8%, and 0.23% had died, that implies that the entire population of the UK has been infected. As we’ve written before, this is almost certainly not the case. The figures don’t show high enough rates of infection for this to be the case. It’s true that the average age of death involving Covid-19 is 82. That was the average age of people whose deaths were registered in England and Wales between October 2020 and January 2021 which involved Covid-19. It’s been estimated that people who die of Covid lose, on average, around ten years of life.","https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=387100835942532,https://www.facebook.com/demikate.ivemadeitthisfar/videos/120301673544611/,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3790399,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-real-world-uk-data-shows-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-provides-high-levels-of-protection-from-the-first-dose,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.01.21252652v1,https://healthmedia.blog.gov.uk/2021/03/12/covid19vaccines-faqs/,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/one-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-can-cut-household-transmission-by-up-to-half,https://khub.net/documents/135939561/390853656/Impact+of+vaccination+on+household+transmission+of+SARS-COV-2+in+England.pdf/35bf4bb1-6ade-d3eb-a39e-9c9b25a8122a?t=1619601878136,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-19-vaccines/,https://www.modernatx.com/modernas-work-potential-vaccine-against-covid-19,https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/covid-19-vaccine-azd1222-showed-robust-immune-responses-in-all-participants-in-phase-i-ii-trial.html,https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/astrazeneca-us-vaccine-trial-met-primary-endpoint.html,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-share-positive-early-data-lead-mrna,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-confirm-high-efficacy-and-no-serious,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/vaccine-development,https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-positive-interim-phase-1-data-its-mrna-vaccine,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-data-preclinical-studies-mrna,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-19-survival-rate-less-998/,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-ifr-more-01/,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/timeseries/ukpop/pop,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-19-survival-rate-less-998/,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/datasets/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveydata,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/adhocs/12773averageageofdeathmedianandmeanofpersonswhosedeathwasduetocovid19orinvolvedcovid19bysexdeathsregisteredinweekending9october2020toweekending1january2021englandandwales,https://fullfact.org/health/covid19-behind-the-death-toll/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/death-rate-statistics-Covid-19/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",This Morning guest makes misleading claims on vaccine efficacy,,,,,,

The survival rate is almost certainly lower than this in the UK, as we’ve written before.  We’ve covered elsewhere how  estimates for Europe (countries with similar age profiles and healthcare quality as the UK) put the fatality rate at somewhere between 0.5% and 1%, meaning the “survival rate” could be somewhere between 99% and 99.5%, but not as high as 99.8%. Covid-19 is more dangerous in older populations, which is part of the reason survival rates vary between countries. As of 14 May there have been about 153,000 deaths registered with Covid-19 recorded as a cause on the death certificate. That’s about 0.23% of the entire UK population. If the survival rate really was 99.8%, and 0.23% had died, that implies that the entire population of the UK has been infected. As we’ve written before, this is almost certainly not the case. The figures don’t show high enough rates of infection for this to be the case. It’s true that the average age of death involving Covid-19 is 82. That was the average age of people whose deaths were registered in England and Wales between October 2020 and January 2021 which involved Covid-19. It’s been estimated that people who die of Covid lose, on average, around ten years of life.","https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=387100835942532,https://www.facebook.com/demikate.ivemadeitthisfar/videos/120301673544611/,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3790399,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-real-world-uk-data-shows-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-provides-high-levels-of-protection-from-the-first-dose,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.01.21252652v1,https://healthmedia.blog.gov.uk/2021/03/12/covid19vaccines-faqs/,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/one-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-can-cut-household-transmission-by-up-to-half,https://khub.net/documents/135939561/390853656/Impact+of+vaccination+on+household+transmission+of+SARS-COV-2+in+England.pdf/35bf4bb1-6ade-d3eb-a39e-9c9b25a8122a?t=1619601878136,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-19-vaccines/,https://www.modernatx.com/modernas-work-potential-vaccine-against-covid-19,https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/covid-19-vaccine-azd1222-showed-robust-immune-responses-in-all-participants-in-phase-i-ii-trial.html,https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/astrazeneca-us-vaccine-trial-met-primary-endpoint.html,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-share-positive-early-data-lead-mrna,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-confirm-high-efficacy-and-no-serious,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/vaccine-development,https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-positive-interim-phase-1-data-its-mrna-vaccine,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-data-preclinical-studies-mrna,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-19-survival-rate-less-998/,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-ifr-more-01/,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/timeseries/ukpop/pop,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-19-survival-rate-less-998/,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/datasets/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveydata,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/adhocs/12773averageageofdeathmedianandmeanofpersonswhosedeathwasduetocovid19orinvolvedcovid19bysexdeathsregisteredinweekending9october2020toweekending1january2021englandandwales,https://fullfact.org/health/covid19-behind-the-death-toll/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/death-rate-statistics-Covid-19/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",This Morning guest makes misleading claims on vaccine efficacy,,,,,,
52,,,,False,Abbas Panjwani,2021-05-28,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/online/luc-montagnier/,Luc Montagnier has said there is no chance for survival for people who receive a Covid-19 vaccine.,2021-05-28,fullfact,,"It’s been claimed that Luc Montagnier, a Nobel Laureate, has said there is no chance of survival for people who have received a Covid-19 vaccine. Posts sharing this text also claim that all vaccinated people will die within two years. Professor Montagnier, who led the team that first identified HIV, has expressed views against the Covid-19 vaccination process but there is no evidence he has said they will die within two years or that they have no chance of surviving. A clip sometimes posted alongside these sorts of claims is a two-minute long excerpt from a longer 11 minute interview with Professor Montagnier which has been translated from French into English. In the 11 minute French original, Professor Montagnier does not make the claims attributed to him. There is no evidence we could find which shows he has made these claims anywhere else.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=472286090654699&set=a.110160096867302&type=3,https://www.instagram.com/p/CPLaWr5t9xN/?utm_source=ig_embed,https://www.instagram.com/p/CPMP57lnq17/?utm_source=ig_embed,https://www.instagram.com/p/CPMSTHRDkla/?utm_source=ig_embed,https://www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/laureates/montagnier,https://www.facebook.com/veronica.major.3158/videos/431140964720333,https://www.facebook.com/VoieNature/videos/1215893138843019/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-hospitalisations-vaccine-patrick-vallance/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/daily-cases-vaccine-coverage/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/the-light-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/paris-protests-photograph/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/death-rate-statistics-Covid-19/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",No evidence Nobel Laureate said vaccinated people will die in two years,,,,,,
