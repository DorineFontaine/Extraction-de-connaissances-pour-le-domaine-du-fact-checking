Her publicist said she and her children are “fully vaccinated” against COVID-19. Fact Check:   The meme features a picture of “The Big Bang Theory” actress Bialik, who received a doctorate in neuroscience from UCLA. It alleges she “refuses to vaccinate” and contains the hashtag “SmartParentsDon’tVax.” (RELATED: Image Claims To Show A CDC Infographic Saying ‘Refusing To Take The Vaccine Is A Form Of Racism’) Bialik, who has faced criticism for prior comments she has made about vaccines, has said she and her children are vaccinated, however. In an October 2020 YouTube video, Bialik stated that she would be getting both the COVID-19 and flu vaccine this year and that her two children would also be getting flu vaccines. “This year I’m going to do something I literally haven’t done in 30 years. I’m going to get a vaccine. And guess what? I’m actually going to get two,” Bialik said in the video. “Number one vaccine that I’m going to get is the COVID vaccine. I can’t wait for it, bring it on. Number two vaccine, I’m going to get a flu vaccine.” She also stated in the video, “My 12- and 15-year old children have never received a flu vaccine. This year, roll up them shirt sleeves, boys, vaccines for everyone.” At one point in the video, she says that she believes the perception that she is anti-vaccination stems from a book she wrote about her experience parenting, noting, “At the time my children had not received the typical schedule of vaccines, but I have never, not once, said that vaccines are not valuable, not useful or not necessary, because they are.”  “As of today, my children may not have had every one of the vaccinations that your children have, but my children are vaccinated. I repeat: my children are vaccinated,” she said in the October 2020 YouTube video. In a February 2015 tweet, she also said her kids are vaccinated. Bialik expressed support for COVID-19 vaccines in a January 2021 interview with Yahoo! Life and in a May 2021 interview with Cheddar News. In both interviews, she said her children were vaccinated and, in the Cheddar News interview, confirmed she received the COVID-19 vaccine. “It’s not ‘I’m pro every single vaccine that anyone talks about all the time everywhere, every single minute,'” she said, according to Yahoo! Life. “I have a lot of questions about the vaccine industry, as do a lot of people. I have a lot of questions about the profits involved. [But] when it comes to this virus, the insidiousness of this virus, the way this virus works, the way that it adapts, we absolutely need to see this as distinctly different from the flu. It’s different than the common cold. This is something we need absolute protection from.”  if(dc_showing_ads) { var scr = document.createElement('script'); scr.async= true; scr.src = ""https://get.civicscience.com/jspoll/5/csw-polyfills.js""; document.getElementsByTagName(""body"")[0].appendChild(scr); } Heather Besignano, Bialik’s publicist, told Check Your Fact that “Mayim and her children are all fully vaccinated for the COVID-19 virus.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The footage actually shows French police showing support for health care workers protesting in June 2020. Fact Check:   Protests broke out in multiple French cities after French President Emmanuel Macron announced new COVID-19-related rules on July 12, Reuters reported. The rules include mandating health care workers be vaccinated by September 15, and requiring health passes showing proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test in order to enter venues such as restaurants, bars and theaters, as well as board trains and planes, according to the outlet. A video shared on Facebook on July 17 purportedly shows a scene from the recent protests in which law enforcement personnel placed their helmets on the ground as civilians gathered around them and applauded. “Police in France with the people of France take off their helmets,” the video’s caption reads. “This happened during this weeks protests ! Let’s goooo France.” (RELATED: Does This Image Show An ‘Electric Car Cemetery’ In France?) The video, however, predates the recent demonstrations against COVID-19 restrictions in France. Through a reverse image search of key frames, Check Your Fact found similar footage published on YouTube by French magazine L’Obs in June 2020, with the title: “Police officers and caregivers applaud during the demonstration in Nîmes.”  The video showed police in Nimes, France, on June 16, 2020, acknowledging health care workers who were protesting in support of a public hospital there, according to a translation of the video’s description. Tens of thousands of French medical workers demonstrated on June 16, 2020, advocating for the country’s government to raise health service wages, pause service cuts and stop hospitals from closing amid the pandemic, France 24 reported. The government signed an agreement with unions on July 13, 2020 enacting roughly $9 billion in wage increases for health care personnel, according to BBC News.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/cynara.issa/posts/10159363056387180,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/french-police-quell-protest-against-covid-health-passport-rules-2021-07-14/,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-make-covid-19-shot-mandatory-health-workers-bfm-tv-2021-07-12/,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/07/14/fact-check-image-electric-car-cemetery-france/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLlvS7Fnyb0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLlvS7Fnyb0,https://www.france24.com/en/20200616-enough-applause-french-health-workers-rally-anew-for-post-coronavirus-reforms,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53398208,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#15616770637a6755767d70767e6c7a6067737476613b767a78",Does This Video Show French Police Setting Down Their Helmets In Support Of Protesters In July 2021?,,,,,,
2,,,,False,,,,checkyourfact,,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/07/23/fact-check-canada-prohibit-pilots-covid-vaccine-flying/,Does Canada Prohibit Pilots Who Received COVID-19 Vaccines From Flying?,2021-07-23,checkyourfact,,"FACT CHECK: Does Canada Prohibit Pilots Who Received COVID-19 Vaccines From Flying?2:21 PM 07/23/2021Brad Sylvester | Fact Check Reporter share on facebook tweet this show commentsAn image shared on Facebook claims Canada prohibits all pilots who received COVID-19 vaccines from flying.  Verdict: False The Canadian government allows pilots who have received Health Canada-approved COVID-19 vaccines to fly. Fact Check:   The image shows the headline of a July 11 post from the website Alt News that reads, “Canada Prohibits All Vaxxed Pilots From Flying. The Corona Vax Is A ‘Medical Trial’ And Such ‘Vaccinations’ Are Ruled To Ground All Pilots.” (RELATED: Viral Post Claims Fox News Isn’t Available In Canada) Below the headline, there is a screen grab of the Canadian government’s website from the Transport Canada section titled “COVID-19 vaccines and Aviation Medical Certificate holders.” A highlighted line in the screen grab states that “participation in medical trials is not considered compatible with aviation medical certification.” While the post attempts to allege that all Canadian pilots who received COVID-19 vaccines are prohibited from flying because the vaccines are supposedly considered a “medical trial,” that is not the case. The Canadian government’s website explicitly states that COVID-19 vaccines approved by Health Canada “are considered compatible with Transport Canada aviation Medical Certification.” That means pilots who received them are allowed to fly. Health Canada has approved the COVID-19 vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca. The Canadian government’s website states, “Only vaccines that are proven to be safe, effective and of high quality are authorized for use in Canada. The COVID-19 vaccines have been rigorously tested during their development and then carefully reviewed by Health Canada.”  Sau Sau Liu, a spokesperson for Transport Canada, confirmed in an email to Check Your Fact that the post’s claim is inaccurate, saying, “Transport Canada does not prohibit pilots vaccinated with Health Canada-approved vaccines to fly nor do we impose grounding periods for aviators who wish to take vaccines approved by Health Canada.” The Transport Canada section of the Canadian government’s website also states, “Transport Canada (TC) Civil Aviation Medicine (CAM), does not impose grounding periods for aviators who wish to take vaccines approved by Health Canada.” “All COVID-19 vaccines currently available in Canada have gone through clinical trials and been tested on tens of thousands of adult volunteers before being authorized for use,” Liu also said. “They were deemed to be safe and effective and have been licensed and authorized by Health Canada. They are not medical trials.” The notice about it being the “general position of TC CAM that participation in medical trials is not considered compatible with aviation medical certification” on the webpage was included earlier in the pandemic “when aviators started asking if they could take part in the vaccine trials that Health Canada was undertaking prior to the approval of the vaccines for general distribution,” according to Liu.  if(dc_showing_ads) { var scr = document.createElement('script'); scr.async= true; scr.src = ""https://get.civicscience.com/jspoll/5/csw-polyfills.js""; document.getElementsByTagName(""body"")[0].appendChild(scr); } Liu told Check Your Fact that because Health Canada has approved the COVID-19 vaccines for use and the notice about medical trials “is less relevant,” Transport Canada has since removed it from the webpage.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no record of Macron making this statement. Fact Check: The French government recently announced that it would mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for all health care workers, according to Reuters. The government also set forth requirements that people would need passes documenting they have been vaccinated against COVID-19, recently tested negative for the virus or recovered from the illness in order to enter venues such as restaurants, bars and theaters, the outlet reported.   Now, an image on Facebook shows what appears to be a screen grab of a tweet seemingly quoting the French president. “I no longer have any intention of sacrificing my life, my time, my freedom and the adolescence of my daughters, as well as their right to study properly, for those who refuse to be vaccinated,” Macron purportedly said. “This time you stay at home, not us.” There is, however, no record of Macron saying the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. Check Your Fact reviewed a speech Macron gave on July 12, but found no mention of him saying people who refuse to be vaccinated should stay home. The supposed quote was not found on the Élysée Palace website either. A search of Macron’s verified social media accounts likewise turned up no instances of the alleged quote. Furthermore, the French president has three adult stepchildren and no biological children of his own, The Sun reported in 2020. (RELATED: Does This Image Show A 2021 Protest Against France’s COVID-19 Measures?) The misattribution may stem from confusion surrounding an Instagram post from Italian journalist Selvaggia Lucarelli. Lucarelli posted a picture of Macron and included a similar quote to the one erroneously attributed to Macron as the caption. The quote is not attributed to Macron in the post.  “I’m for the French line right now. I no longer have any intention whatsoever of sacrificing my life, my time, and my son’s adolescence, in addition to his right to study properly, for those who refuse to get vaccinated,” a translation of Lucarelli’s Instagram caption reads. “This time you stay home, not us.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no evidence that Castro has fled Cuba. The image featured in the post was taken in 2015 and shows Castro landing in Costa Rica to attend a summit. Fact Check:   Thousands of Cubans angered by food and medicine shortages participated in anti-government protests on July 11, with many calling for freedom and for Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel to resign, CNN reported. Now, an image on Facebook shows Castro exiting a plane and claims he fled to Venezuela during the protests. “BREAKING – Cuba: Former President Raúl Castro flees to Venezuela,” reads the image’s caption. “He arrived in Caracas around 11:37 pm, Sunday, July 11, 2021 as massive anti-government protests erupted in the socialist regime.” There is no evidence, however, that Castro fled to Venezuela on July 11. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found the photo in a January 2015 article published by La Nación, explaining it shows him arriving in Costa Rica to attend that year’s Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) summit. “Raúl Castro arrived at the Juan Santamaría airport to attend the Celac Summit that starts tomorrow in the country,” reads a translation of the image’s caption on La Nación. “He is the first president to arrive on Costa Rican soil and was received by Vice President Ana Helena Chacón.”  The photo was also included in articles published by Cuba Debate and teleSUR. Both outlets also reported the image showed Castro arriving in Costa Rica for the CELAC summit. (RELATED: Does This Video Show A Recent Anti-Government Protest In Cuba?) Had Castro actually fled Cuba during the July 11 protests, media outlets likely would have reported on it, yet none have.”Raúl Castro is very well and in Cuba,” said Noraimis Ramos Ruiz, a spokesperson for the Cuban government, in an email to Check Your Fact. Castro appeared at a pro-government rally in Havana, Cuba on July 17, according to the Associated Press.  if(dc_showing_ads) { var scr = document.createElement('script'); scr.async= true; scr.src = ""https://get.civicscience.com/jspoll/5/csw-polyfills.js""; document.getElementsByTagName(""body"")[0].appendChild(scr); }  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no evidence Rice has been convicted of treason or sentenced to death. The claim stems from a website that says it publishes “humor, parody, and satire.” Fact Check:   The lengthy post claims the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps on July 8 convicted Rice of “high treason” for “her participation in a 2017 scheme to defame” former President Donald Trump in connection to alleged “Russian collusion.” Rice, who served as former President Barack Obama’s national security adviser from 2013 to 2017, faced scrutiny for her role in “unmasking” some Trump transition officials in intelligence reports on communications with foreigners under surveillance, according to CNBC. In the post, it also alleges Navy Vice Admiral John Hannink was involved in her trial. At the end of the trial, a “three-officer panel unanimously agreed Rice be put to death for her crimes against America,” the post claims. There is, however, no evidence Rice was convicted of treason or sentenced to death. A search of press releases put out by the Department of Justice and the Department of Defense didn’t turn up any announcements to that effect. National media outlets haven’t reported on Rice getting convicted of treason. She has also been active on Twitter since July 8, the date she was supposedly sentenced to death, further adding to the post’s dubiousness. “No truth to this claim,” a Department of Defense spokesperson said in an email to Check Your Fact. (RELATED: No, Donald Rumsfeld Did Not Commit Suicide At A Military Tribunal)  The text in the Facebook post matches that in a July 20 article published by Real Raw News, a website that states on its “About Us” page that it “contains humor, parody, and satire.” While Real Raw News includes that disclaimer, the Facebook post does not, resulting in some users seemingly believing the story is real.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no evidence Trump released the statement. The fabricated press release appears to originate from a Twitter user as a joke. Fact Check:   The Tampa Bay Buccaneers won Super Bowl LV in February, marking Brady’s seventh Super Bowl win, according to CBS Sports. Brady and his teammates on July 20 visited the White House, where the quarterback cracked a joke about people not believing the Buccaneers won the Super Bowl, footage from The Hill shows. “Not a lot of people think that we could have won and, in fact, I think about 40 percent of people still don’t think we won,” Brady said, referencing people who deny President Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election. Shortly after Brady made the joke, social media users started sharing a screen grab of what looks like a statement from Trump. In the alleged press release, the former president appears to respond to Brady’s joke, calling the quarterback “shady.” “Tom ‘Shady’ needs to do his research and realize how Rigged (and Rigged it was) the last election was,” the purported Trump statement reads. “Maybe he was too busy Deflating balls (weak grip?) to follow what is happening all around our Great Country (including Maricopa County, Georgia and Pennsylvania).

So much Voter Fraud!”  There is, however, no record of Trump putting out the statement pictured in the Facebook post. A search of Trump’s website, as well as his 45office.com website, didn’t turn up any statements calling Brady “shady.” (RELATED: Did Tom Brady Say, ‘If Anybody On This Team Kneels, I Walk’?) Brady’s joke at the White House was widely covered by national news outlets. If Trump had put out the statement in response, it would have been picked up by the media, yet no major news outlets have reported on it. Multiple Twitter users also shared the fake statement on Twitter. The fabricated press release appears to have been originally posted by the Twitter user @skolanach, whose handle is visible in the upper-left corner.

Verdict: False Rumsfeld’s cause of death was multiple myeloma. The claim appears to stem from a website that says it publishes “humor, parody, and satire.” Fact Check:   Rumsfeld, the Defense secretary to former Presidents Gerald Ford and George W. Bush, died on June 29 at 88 years old, according to CNBC. Now, some social media users are sharing a post claiming Rumsfeld actually died by suicide during a military tribunal. Rumsfeld did not, however, commit suicide, and was never on trial before a military tribunal. No mention of such a trial or any charges against him can be found in press releases published by the Justice Department or the Defense Department. Current Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin tweeted on June 30 that he was “saddened to hear” about Rumsfeld’s death, stating, “I extend my deep condolences to his family and loved ones.” Had Rumsfeld committed suicide at a military tribunal, media outlets certainly would have reported on it, yet none have done so. Keith Urbahn, Rumsfeld’s spokesperson, said multiple myeloma caused his death, USA Today reported. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show Article About Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin Considering ‘Defunding, Maybe Disbanding’ The US Army) The claim appears to stem from a July 18 article published by Real Raw News bearing the headline: “Rumsfeld Committed Suicide at Military Tribunal; Did Not Die of Natural Causes.” The article goes on to claim Rumsfeld was arrested on May 27, and that he killed himself after the military tribunal found him responsible for the deaths of American soldiers during the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars.  Real Raw News includes a disclaimer on it’s “About Us” page that states, “This website contains humor, parody, and satire.” Despite the disclaimer, social media users have shared the claim without such a warning, seemingly believing it to be true. This is not the first time a claim stemming from a Real Raw News article has been shared as misinformation. In June, Check Your Fact debunked the baseless claim that former FBI Director James Comey was sentenced to death by guillotine.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/suzanne.m.kelly1/posts/10223920952805678,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/30/former-defense-secretary-donald-rumsfeld-dead-at-88.html,https://www.justice.gov/news?keys=Donald+Rumsfeld&items_per_page=25,https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/releases/Search/Rumsfeld/,https://twitter.com/secdef/status/1410380667163185152,https://www.google.com/search?q=Donald+Rumsfeld+suicide+military+tribunal&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwim44vJ8PTxAhW8FVkFHbRMCAgQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1920&bih=897,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/06/30/donald-rumsfeld-dies-ex-pentagon-chief-iraq-afghanistan-wars/7810730002/,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/01/26/fact-check-article-defense-secretary-lloyd-austin-defunding-disbanding-army/,https://realrawnews.com/2021/07/rumsfeld-committed-suicide-at-military-tribunal-did-not-die-of-natural-causes/,https://realrawnews.com/about-us/,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/06/18/fact-check-james-comey-sentenced-death-guillotine/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#790d0b1c0f160b391a111c1a1200160c0b1f181a0d571a1614","No, Donald Rumsfeld Did Not Commit Suicide At A Military Tribunal",,,,,,

However, the photo is doctored. (RELATED: Did Ron DeSantis Not Give A Press Conference About The Surfside Condo Collapse Before June 29?)

Maybe it’s time to issue an executive order requiring all Popeyes in Florida to re-stock them ASAP??”  A schedule available on the Florida governor’s website shows DeSantis visited the Miami office of Restaurant Brands International, the parent company of Popeyes, on Sept. 27, 2019. The News Service of Florida also reported on his visit at the time. The novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 first emerged in late 2019, according to The New York Times. DeSantis did not, according to the Washington Post, issue a statewide mask mandate last year, though he did institute a lockdown in April 2020. In May, he signed an executive order suspending local COVID-19 rules for individuals and businesses, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Friends of Ron DeSantis, the governor’s political committee, recently started selling merchandise such as “Don’t Fauci My Florida” t-shirts and “How the hell am I going to be able to drink a beer with a mask on?” beer koozies, according to the Tallahassee Democrat. None of the merchandise for sale matches the t-shirt in the photoshopped image.  if(dc_showing_ads) { var scr = document.createElement('script'); scr.async= true; scr.src = ""https://get.civicscience.com/jspoll/5/csw-polyfills.js""; document.getElementsByTagName(""body"")[0].appendChild(scr); } The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends for individuals ages 2 and older who are not fully vaccinated to wear masks in public indoor spaces to help protect against COVID-19. Fully vaccinated individuals “can resume activities without wearing a mask or physically distancing, except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance,” according to the CDC website.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsRyan KingContributor","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158662044432756&set=a.10152960751952756&type=3,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158662044432756&set=a.10152960751952756&type=3,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/07/06/fact-check-ron-desantis-press-conference-surfside-condo-collapse/,https://twitter.com/GovRonDeSantis/status/1177677167251148801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/popeyeschicken?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/BurgerKing?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://t.co/SagYhmAxcj,https://twitter.com/GovRonDeSantis/status/1177677167251148801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/GovRonDeSantis/status/1177677167251148801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/9.27.19.png,https://www.mypanhandle.com/news/gov-ron-desantis-wants-to-taste-test-popeyes-and-chick-fil-a-chicken-sandwiches/,https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-timeline.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/07/13/desantis-fauci-florida/,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/01/825383186/florida-governor-orders-statewide-lockdown,https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2021/05/04/what-we-know-about-desantis-executive-order-suspending-local-covid-19-restrictions/,https://twitter.com/teamrondesantis/status/1414676440533159937,https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2021/07/15/ron-desantis-releases-merchandise-against-masks-and-anthony-fauci-florida-coronavirus/7976313002/,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html",Did Ron DeSantis Pose For A Photo Holding Up This Anti-Mask Shirt?,,,,,,

Rockefeller’s advisor Frederick Taylor Gates.  Verdict: False Bill Gates is not Frederick Taylor Gates’ grandson. Fact Check:   The image shows what appears to be a screen grab of Frederick Taylor Gates’ Wikipedia entry displayed on Google. Green text added to the screen grab claims he is Bill Gates’ grandfather. Frederick Taylor Gates managed Rockefeller’s charitable activities and was instrumental in the founding of the philanthropic Rockefeller Foundation, serving on its board of trustees until 1923, according to The Rockefeller Archive Center. (RELATED: Have Bill Gates, Anthony Fauci, The WHO And Others Been Charged With War Crimes?) Despite sharing a surname with Frederick Taylor Gates, Bill Gates is not his grandson. Bill Gates’ father and mother were Bill Gates Sr. and Mary Maxwell, who died in 2020 and 1994 respectively, according to NBC News. Bill Gates Sr., also known as William H. Gates II, was born in 1925 to furniture store owners in Washington state, ABC News reported. Frederick Taylor Gates died in 1929, while his wife Emma Cahoon Gates lived until 1934, The New York Times reported. They had seven children, according to his autobiography “Chapters in My Life,” none of whom were named William or Mary.  An internet search by Check Your Fact found no credible media report of Frederick Taylor Gates being Bill Gates’ grandfather. Bill Gates hasn’t mentioned Frederick Taylor Gates in any entry of his personal blog either. The Rockefeller Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation collaborated in 2006 to create the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), an initiative to lessen poverty in the continent through agricultural investment, according to The Rockefeller Foundation’s website.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/miguel.cuervo.5249/posts/188296246565526,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Frederick-T-Gates,https://rockfound.rockarch.org/biographical/-/asset_publisher/6ygcKECNI1nb/content/frederick-t-gates?,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/05/13/fact-check-image-bill-gates-anthony-fauci-violating-social-distancing-guidelines-coronavirus/,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bill-gates-sr-father-microsoft-co-founder-dies-94-n1240189,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/bill-gates-sr-father-microsoft-founder-dies-94-73033685,https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1929/02/07/95877097.pdf?pdf_redirect=true&ip=0,https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1934/04/07/93757961.pdf,https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/35101532/frederick-taylor-gates,https://www.google.com/books/edition/Chapters_in_My_Life/1Yu5AAAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0,https://www.google.com/search?q=frederick+taylor+gates+Bill+Gates+grandfather&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjr2MuDw_TxAhXAFFkFHYujBjoQ_AUoAHoECAcQAg&biw=1440&bih=717&dpr=2,https://www.gatesnotes.com/Search?search=%22Frederick%20Taylor%20Gates%22,https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/initiative/alliance-for-a-green-revolution-in-africa/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d3a7a1b6a5bca193b0bbb6b0b8aabca6a1b5b2b0a7fdb0bcbe",Is Bill Gates The Grandson Of Rockefeller Foundation Co-Founder Frederick Taylor Gates?,,,,,,

Verdict: False Biden has been photoshopped into the photo. Fact Check:   The “Drivers License” singer visited the White House last week as part of the Biden administration’s effort to encourage more young people to get COVID-19 vaccinations, according to the Associated Press. Following her White House visit, some social media users started sharing an altered image appearing to show Biden touching her shoulders. In the original picture taken by photographer Oliver Contreras for Bloomberg in the White House briefing room, only Rodrigo and White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki can be seen. Biden did not attend the July 14 briefing in which Rodrigo participated, a review of the transcript and footage from the briefing shows. (RELATED: Viral Image Makes False Claim About Joe And Jill Biden’s Relationship) Biden has been digitally edited into the photo of Rodrigo and Psaki in the briefing room. The picture of Biden comes from the 2015 swearing-in ceremony for former Defense Secretary Ash Carter, when the then-vice president put his hands on the shoulders of Ash Carter’s wife Stephanie and spoke to her. Some people pointed to the picture of Biden and Stephanie Carter during the 2020 presidential election cycle to criticize him for his interactions with women. Stephanie Carter said in a 2019 Medium post that the picture had been “misleadingly” taken out-of-context and that Biden touched her shoulders “as a means of offering his support.”  Rodrigo and Biden did share actual photos of them together during her White House visit to their respective Instagram accounts.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMecca FowlerContributor","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=4418281911550182&set=a.600404043338007&type=3&theater,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmDBbnmKpqQ,https://apnews.com/article/olivia-rodrigo-visits-white-house-vaccines-07aeaeb169aa7daed999dd48d57e06a0,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=4418281911550182&set=a.600404043338007&type=3&theater,https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/jen-psaki-white-house-press-secretary-right-introduces-pop-news-photo/1233977853?adppopup=true,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/07/14/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-july-14-2021/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek6Y3jzOLP4,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/01/28/fact-check-joe-jill-biden-babysitter-wife-hospitalized/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3gGncZMCKQ,https://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/Obama-Defense-Secretary-/d6517cafb1ce43a18fd9fb9abd5202e9/2/0,https://www.vox.com/2019/4/2/18290345/joe-biden-lucy-flores-amy-lappos,https://medium.com/@scarterdc/the-metoo-story-that-wasnt-me-6c1d5eb1e94d,https://www.instagram.com/p/CRU-J7yr2jT/?utm_medium=copy_link,https://www.instagram.com/p/CRU9pq4rEKj/",Does This Image Show Joe Biden Touching Olivia Rodrigo’s Shoulders?,,,,,,

The claim appears to stem from a satirical article. Fact Check:   The Facebook photo shows what appears to be a screen grab of a June 21 article including an image of Biden and bearing the headline: “Announces Americans Not Vaccinated Before 2022 Will Be Put In Camps.” Text in the screen grab goes on to say that unvaccinated Americans will be detained in “quarantine camps” until they are vaccinated. There is no record, however, of Biden making such an announcement. A search of the White House’s website turned up no mention of imprisoning unvaccinated Americans. Check Your Fact also searched Biden’s verified social media accounts, but found no instances of him announcing such a plan. While the Biden administration has been actively working to get more Americans vaccinated against COVID-19, according to The New York Times, Check Your Fact found no news reporting about the president announcing any plan to imprison those who refuse to be vaccinated. (RELATED: Did Joe Biden Announce Looting Would Be Renamed ‘Justice Shopping’?) The screen grabbed article in the Facebook post appears to have been published by Value Walk, a website that “provides unique coverage on hedge funds, large asset managers, and value investing,” according to its “About” section. A clear disclaimer at the bottom of the article says, “This is a satirical article.”  Value Walk also included a notice that the article was first posted by The Stonk Market, a financial satire website. While both Value Walk and The Stonk Market include disclaimers about the satirical nature of the story, social media users have been sharing the claim without such a warning, seemingly believing the erroneous claim to be true.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

There were also no major solar storms last week. Fact Check:   Solar storms are natural phenomena that occur when disturbances on the sun, such as solar flares or coronal mass ejections, emit electromagnetic radiation and charged particle radiation into the solar system, according to CBS News. Under certain conditions, such solar activity can disrupt satellites as well as technologies on Earth like GPS and radio communications, according to NASA. The July 14 Instagram post claims a “massive solar storm” that can impact GPS, internet and satellites is heading toward Earth. However, there is no mention of an imminent solar storm to that effect on the Space Weather Prediction Center’s three-day forecast, and no such storm occurred last week. The forecast on Monday said, “Solar activity is likely to remain very low with a slight chance for C-class flares on 19-21 Jul,” while Tuesday’s forecast currently states, “Solar activity is expected to be very low, with an increasing chance of C-class flares 20-22 Jul.” C-class solar flares are “too weak to noticeably affect Earth,” according to NASA. “The solar observations have been greatly mischaracterized,” Theo Stein, a spokesperson for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), said in an email to Check Your Fact. (RELATED: No, This Is Not A ‘Photo From Mars’ Fabricated By NASA)  The last significant solar activity registered by the NOAA occurred on July 3, when an X-1 solar flare was observed.

Verdict: False While Make-A-Wish is requiring families to be vaccinated for wishes involving air travel and large crowds, it is not denying wishes to unvaccinated children. The claim appears to stem from a misunderstanding of a video from the Make-A-Wish CEO. Fact Check:   The Make-A-Wish Foundation is a non-profit organization that grants wishes to critically ill children, according to the foundation’s website. Now, a post on Facebook claims the organization decided to only grant wishes to children who are fully vaccinated. The coronavirus pandemic put thousands of wishes on hold due to stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions and event cancellations, NBC South Florida reported in May 2020. Other children had to alter their wishes, according to USA Today. There is no evidence, however, that Make-A-Wish is refusing to grant wishes to unvaccinated children. An internet search conducted by Check Your Fact found no media outlets reporting that the foundation is mandating vaccines before children can receive wishes, only other fact-checking outlets debunking the claim. The claim appears to stem from a deceptively edited video shared on Twitter, that showed Make-A-Wish CEO Richard Davis speaking about updates to Make-A-Wish’s COVID-19 policies. In the edited video, Davis says wishes involving air travel within the U.S. and large gatherings will resume September 15, but will require all participants, including the child making a wish, to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.  The Twitter video, which was originally sent in an email to Make-A-Wish families, was edited to end before Davis finished explaining which children would be eligible for wishes involving air travel and large gatherings, the Associated Press reported. (RELATED: Does The Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine Contain Graphene Oxide?) The foundation on June 28 published a statement on its website clarifying the misinformation surrounding its vaccine policy. “Make-A-Wish has not, does not and will not deny wishes to children who are not vaccinated,” the statement reads, in part. “Since the beginning of the pandemic, Make-A-Wish has safely granted over 6,500 wishes to children and families – regardless of vaccination status. Make-A-Wish will continue to grant wishes to children who are not vaccinated.” The statement goes on to explain that there are other types of wishes to choose from that don’t require being vaccinated, such as road trips, shopping sprees, meeting a celebrity and room decorations. The vaccine policy does not apply to children who have received a terminal prognosis, according to the statement.  if(dc_showing_ads) { var scr = document.createElement('script'); scr.async= true; scr.src = ""https://get.civicscience.com/jspoll/5/csw-polyfills.js""; document.getElementsByTagName(""body"")[0].appendChild(scr); }  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMecca FowlerContributor","https://www.facebook.com/MarchAgainstCorruption/posts/2326354117495293,https://wish.org/about-us,https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/coronavirus/make-a-wish-trying-to-make-dreams-come-true-during-pandemic/2227685/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/lifestyle/2020/08/19/make-a-wish-still-helping-dreams-come-true-during-pandemic-mdash-just-different-ones/113347928/,https://www.google.com/search?q=Make-A-wish+refusing+to+grant+wishes+unvaccinated+children&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS890US890&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjjmpTgo_LxAhVrElkFHSLbCVsQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1440&bih=717,https://twitter.com/Pelham_3/status/1407964106653536256,https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-business-6ecfe4db4e9eef5d0577a11aaba0f985,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/07/12/fact-check-pfizer-covid-vaccine-graphene-oxide/,https://wish.org/news-releases/vaccine-policy,https://wish.org/news-releases/vaccine-policy",Is The Make-A-Wish Foundation Only Granting Wishes To Fully Vaccinated Children?,,,,,,

Fact Check:   The image of a woman holding a French flag while a massive crowd gathers below on the Champs-Elysees avenue in Paris has circulated on Instagram and Facebook recently. In numerous instances, users alleged in the captions that it depicts a protest against the French government’s new COVID-19 mitigation measures. The French government recently announced measures that will mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for all health care workers and that will require people get special health passes documenting they have been vaccinated against COVID-19, recently tested negative for the virus or recovered from it to enter venues such as restaurants, bars and theaters, according to Reuters. The announcement of those measures resulted in over 100,000 people protesting across France this past weekend, the Associated Press reported. A reverse image search revealed the photo actually dates back to 2018 and shows people in Paris celebrating the French national soccer team winning the FIFA World Cup. France won the World Cup that year after beating Croatia 4-2 in the final match, NPR reported. AFP photographer Ludovic Marin took the picture. (RELATED: Image Claims To Show Cuban Farmer Before Being Executed For Refusing To Work For The Castro Regime) “This picture taken from the top of the Arch of Triumph (Arc de Triomphe) on July 15, 2018 shows people celebrating France’s victory in the Russia 2018 World Cup final football match between France and Croatia, on the Champs-Elysees avenue in Paris,” reads the caption on Getty Images.

Verdict: False The image, which was taken in 2019, actually shows a farmers’ protest in the Netherlands, not New Zealand. Fact Check:   In recent days, New Zealand farmers have been participating in a demonstration called “Howl Of A Protest,” and have been driving their tractors into cities, causing traffic jams, Reuters reported. The farmers are protesting the New Zealand government’s environmental and climate change policies, among other regulations, that some believe are hurting their business, according to the outlet. Now some social media users have been sharing an image, supposedly from the protests, showing dozens of tractors driving down one side of a highway. “Farmer’s protest today! pukekohe to Auckland,” the image’s caption reads. “Standing up to our tyrannical government that are land grabbing and destroying farmer’s lively hoods. We need to support them for the farmers feed us!” The image does not, however, show the recent New Zealand protests. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found a near-identical photo on Shutterstock. The image shared on Facebook appears to have flipped and cropped the original photo. The photo was actually taken in the Netherlands in 2019, according to its caption on Shutterstock. “Farmers block the A28 Highway with their tractors between Hoogeveen and Meppel in The Netherlands, 01 October 2019,” the image’s caption reads. “The farmers joined a national protest in The Hague.” (RELATED: Did Stacey Abrams Say, ‘We Don’t Need Farmers, When We Have Grocery Stores’?)

Verdict: False The image is a piece of digital artwork, not a photo taken from the International Space Station. Fact Check:   The International Space Station, which orbits about 250 miles above the earth, was assembled in parts between 1998 and 2011, according to NASA. 2020 marked the International Space Station’s 20th year of astronaut crews living on it, the Associated Press reported. The Facebook post claims to show a photo of a solar eclipse taken from the International Space Station. A solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the sun and the earth and blocks the sun’s light, casting a shadow on earth, according to NASA. (RELATED: Is This Image The ‘First Ever’ Photo Of A Sunset On Mars?) While the picture does contain some actual imagery of space, it is not a photo of a solar eclipse taken from the International Space Station. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact discovered it is actually a piece of digital artwork created by Deviant Art user A4size-ska using software called Terragen 2. The image of the Milky Way in the background of the piece comes from the European Space Observatory. The inaccurate claim that the image shows a solar eclipse “viewed from the International Space Station” has circulated online since at least 2012. In an article for Discover Magazine that year, astronomer Phil Plait debunked the claim, noting that “the bright Earth (and Sun!) would wash out the background stars in a picture like this, so you’d not see them, and certainly not the Milky Way.” Gizmodo also reported that the image was a “3D rendering made in Terragen 2” by the Deviant Art user.  This isn’t the first time social media users have mistaken a piece of digital artwork as a genuine photo taken of space. In February, Check Your Fact debunked an image some Facebook users claimed to show “Earth, Venus and Jupiter as seen from Mars” that, in actuality, was computer-generated.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no record of Roberts being arrested for child trafficking, or any other charges. Fact Check:   “Breaking News! Chief Justice John Roberts has been arrested for child trafficking, plus other charges!” the July 14 Facebook post reads, citing someone named Scott Brunswick as the source of the claim. Brunswick has previously been cited as the source for other Facebook posts, including one that falsely claimed former President Donald Trump retained full control of the military. There is no evidence, however, that Roberts was arrested for child trafficking, or anything else. Check Your Fact searched press releases from the Supreme Court and the FBI, but found no mention of Roberts being arrested. Had the chief justice been arrested, major media outlets almost certainly would have reported on it, yet none have. While Supreme Court Justices are able to hold office “as long as they choose,” according to the Supreme Court’s website, they are able to be removed by impeachment. Justices can be impeached for committing “treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanors,” per the U.S. Constitution. If Roberts was arrested for child trafficking, he would likely be susceptible to an impeachment charge from Congress, but there has not been any congressional action taken against him, according to Congress.gov. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Chief Justice John Roberts With Ghislaine Maxwell)  Roberts most recently released a statement July 1 marking the end of the term, and the start of Supreme Court recess until October.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsRyan KingContributor","https://www.facebook.com/star.aquarius.731/posts/4383237421741022,https://www.facebook.com/star.aquarius.731/posts/4265374396860659,https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/pressreleases.aspx,https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel,https://news.google.com/search?q=chief%20justice%20roberts%20arrested&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/faq_general.aspx,https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript,https://www.congress.gov/search?q=%7B%22source%22%3A%22all%22%2C%22congress%22%3A%22117%22%2C%22search%22%3A%22john+roberts%22%7D,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/12/21/fact-check-photo-john-roberts-ghislaine-maxwell-jean-luc-brunel/,https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/pressreleases/pr_07-01-21",Was Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts Arrested?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The video shows soccer fans celebrating in Buenos Aires, Argentina, after the country’s team won the Copa América final against Brazil. Fact Check:    Widespread anti-government protests erupted across Cuba starting July 11, according to The Wall Street Journal. Cubans are protesting the Communist-run government, food and medicine shortages and electricity outages, among other things, the Associated Press reported. Misinformation related to the Cuban anti-government protests has circulated widely on social media in recent days. The inaccurate claim that the video, which has garnered over 1,400 views so far, shows a nighttime protest in the country “right now” is one such example. It actually shows Argentinians in Buenos Aires celebrating the national soccer team’s victory over Brazil in the Copa América final on July 10. The well-known Obelisco de Buenos Aires can be seen in the video lit up with blue lights. Similar footage shared by The Guardian’s soccer-focused Youtube channel, Guardian Football, shows a large crowd of Argentina soccer fans celebrating the July 10 win in the Plaza de la Republica, where the monument is located.   The description of Guardian Football’s video containing the similar footage reads in part, “Thousands took to the streets in Buenos Aires on Saturday night after Argentina beat its historic rival Brazil in the Copa América final.” (RELATED: Does This Photo Show An Anti-Communist Protest In Cuba?)

Fact Check:   The image includes a photo of Kayleigh McEnany surrounded by photos of Jacqueline Kennedy, John F. Kennedy, John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy. Text in the photo lists John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy as Kayleigh McEnany’s grandparents and John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy as her parents. There is, however, no evidence Kayleigh McEnany is directly related to John F. Kennedy.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False The sticker has been digitally edited into the photo. Fact Check: The picture of the BMW supposedly sporting a “Fuck You Greta!” sticker on the back windshield has circulated on Facebook in recent days. The alleged sticker appears to reference Thunberg, a well-known Swedish environmental activist. The image also went viral on Twitter, where one iteration has received over 1,200 retweets and 9,000 likes as of press time.   The anti-Thunberg sticker has been photoshopped into the picture, a reverse image search revealed. The original photo, taken by photographer David Young, can be found in a July 16 article about cars that was published by the German newspaper Bild in connection to flooding in Germany. In the unaltered picture, there are no stickers visible on the car’s window. Countries in Western Europe were recently hit by deadly floods, with at least 160 people having been killed by them in Germany, according to the Associated Press. At least 31 people in Belgium have died in the floods, the outlet reported Monday. (RELATED: Image Claims To Show Greta Thunberg Eating On A Train While Children Watch From Outside) One Twitter user who shared the image later appeared to clarify that it was doctored, saying in part, “Apparently the bumper sticker is photoshopped in, which isn’t surprising since this is in Germany, so presumably it would be in German (or Belgian, Dutch) if it were real.”  Apparently the bumper sticker is photoshopped in, which isn’t surprising since this is in Germany, so presumably it would be in German (or Belgian, Dutch) if it were real.

Verdict: False The photo of the elephant has been photoshopped to include a lioness and lion cub. The image was originally created for an April Fools’ Day prank. Fact Check:   The image seemingly showing a lioness padding alongside an elephant holding a cub with its trunk has circulated online for several years. “It was considered the best photo of this century,” text inside the image states. “A lioness and her cub were crossing the savannah but the heat was excessive and the cub was in great difficulty walking. An elephant realized that the cub would die and carried him in his trunk to a pool of water walking beside his mother. And we call them wild animals.” The image is photoshopped. The unaltered picture of the elephant can be found on Wikimedia Commons. In the original photo, there are no lions accompanying the elephant as it crosses a dirt path. (RELATED: Did Russia Let Over 500 Lions Loose To Keep People Indoors During The Coronavirus Pandemic?) Kruger Sightings, an online service that shares wildlife sightings at South Africa’s Kruger National Park, first tweeted the altered picture on April 1, 2018, with a similar story accompanying it. The caption credits the photo to “Sloof Lirpa,” which is “April Fools” written backwards.  Nadav Ossendryver, the founder of Kruger Sightings, said that it was created as a 2018 April Fools’ Day prank and that it quickly went viral, according to Business Insider South Africa. Ossendryver said some media outlets reached out to him at the time asking for permission to use it, the outlet reported. Despite Kruger Sightings also posting on its website in 2018 that the photoshopped image was an April Fools joke, some social media users have continued to share it, seemingly believing it is a genuine photo of an elephant helping a lioness and her cub.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/jackmason1953/posts/10222471645914304,https://www.facebook.com/jackmason1953/posts/10222471645914304,https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Elephant_side-view_Kruger.jpg,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/03/24/fact-check-russia-500-lions-look-streets-coronavirus/,https://twitter.com/LatestKruger/status/980344432393375744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E980344432393375744%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.co.za%2Fsa-elephant-picture-fools-20-million-people-2018-4,https://www.businessinsider.co.za/sa-elephant-picture-fools-20-million-people-2018-4,https://www.latestsightings.com/single-post/2018/04/01/How-To-Make-Your-April-Fools-Joke-Go-Viral,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4c383e293a233e0c2f24292f273523393e2a2d2f38622f2321",Does This Image Show An Elephant Carrying A Lion Cub?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The video shows a religious festival in Taiwan in April, not a soccer celebration in Italy. Fact Check:   Italy’s national men’s soccer team won the 2020 European Championship after defeating England on July 11, a win that prompted celebrations across the country, according to The New York Times. Now, a July 13 video claims to show supporters of the team setting off a long line of red firecrackers in the street. “Italy’s celebration on euro cup winning,” reads the post’s caption. “No pollution for them ,only India’s Dipawali crackers pollute the world!” (RELATED: Does This Image Show Italian Police Laying Down Their Equipment In Solidarity With People Protesting COVID-19 Restrictions?) Dipawali, or Diwali, is India’s most important holiday, and is typically celebrated with a large festival in which firecrackers and fireworks are ignited, a tradition that has been criticized for contributing to air pollution, according to NPR. The Facebook video does not, however, show a celebration in Italy. Through a reverse image search of key frames, Check Your Fact found similar footage posted on YouTube in April by Taiwanese news outlet Sanli News Network with the title: “Firecrackers stretch for 500 meters to welcome Baishatun Mazu enthusiastically.”  The Baishatun Mazu (or Matsu) Pilgrimage is an annual religious festival in which tens of thousands of people walk 400 kilometers across Taiwan to honor the sea goddess Matsu, according to the Taipei Times. This year’s pilgrimage began on April 11, the outlet reported. Firecrackers are often set off along the route to celebrate the deity, according to Taiwan Panorama.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The video shows a protest in Kenya, not France. Fact Check:   The 31-second video shows an aerial view of people running in different directions on a street as two vehicles shoot water cannons at them. The caption of the video reads, “Resistance begins to mount against President Macron’s plan for mandatory COVID vaccinations of all French citizens.” (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Kenyans In Nairobi Protesting In Solidarity With Nigerians In June 2021?) That description of the video, however, is inaccurate. A keyword search of terms associated with the video turned up several YouTube videos showing the same footage, all of which indicate it actually shows a protest at the University of Nairobi in Kenya. Several landmarks in the video match those visible in a Google Maps street view of University Way, confirming the incident occurred near the University of Nairobi. Kenyan riot police have used water cannons and tear gas on multiple occasions in recent years to disperse protests in Nairobi, and it is unclear which exact demonstration the video shows. Last week, Kenyan riot police used tear gas against University of Nairobi students who were protesting the university’s decision to raise tuition fees, according to AFP. During a recent televised speech, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that due to a recent rise in COVID-19 cases in the country, vaccines would become mandatory for health care workers by September 15, according to France24. He has not mandated COVID-19 vaccines for all French citizens at the time of publication.  The French president announced in the same address that starting in August, anyone who wants to go to certain venues such as restaurants, bars and malls must have a special “health pass” documenting they have been vaccinated against COVID-19, recently tested negative for the virus or recovered from it, according to NPR. The announced rules prompted protests in parts of France, according to Reuters.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The claim appears to stem from a website that does not guarantee the “accuracy, completeness or usefulness” of its information. Fact Check:   The July 8 post includes what appears to be a screen grab of an article with a featured image showing Biden on one knee in front of Rivlin and Ravitz. The article’s headline reads: “Biden Literally Kneels Before Israeli President in Bizarre and Humiliating Display — Pledges Unconditional Support to Israel.” Biden was not, however, kneeling  before the former president as a display of “unconditional support” to Israel. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found the image published in a July 2 article by the Times of Israel. Biden knelt in front of Ravitz in awe of the fact that she has 12 children, the outlet reported. Rivlin met with Biden at the White House in late June to “reset” the relationship between Israel and the U.S., the Washington Post reported. During the meeting, Biden said his commitment to Israel is “ironclad,” according to a transcript of remarks published by the White House. (RELATED: Does This Image Show Mark Zuckerberg Holding An ‘I Stand With Israel’ Sign?) The article in the screen grab appears to have been published by the website en Volve. En Volve includes a disclaimer under the “Website Terms Of Use” section that says: “We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of this information.

Verdict: False The video has been digitally altered. The original video does not show Johnson with a black eye or any visible injury. Fact Check:   Johnson announced all remaining coronavirus restrictions in England would be lifted on July 19, despite a recent surge in COVID-19 cases, according to the Associated Press. The country began slowly lifting restrictions in March, starting with reopening schools, the outlet reported. Now, a video on Facebook seemingly shows a news segment aired on BBC News of Johnson speaking with a black eye. The video was first shared on TikTok July 12 and has over 35,000 likes and 6,100 comments. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Boris Johnson With Ghislaine Maxwell?) The video, however, appears to have been doctored to include the black eye. Check Your Fact found the original video posted on YouTube by BBC on July 12. In the original segment, Johnson is shown speaking at a press conference about England removing the last of the COVID-19 restrictions, and he does not have a black eye.   If Johnson actually gave a press briefing while having a black eye, media outlets likely would have reported on it, yet none have. In 2011, when Johnson was the mayor of London, the Evening Standard reported he showed up to vote with a black eye he received after hitting a security barrier headfirst while cycling. Over 1,200 scientists signed a letter to The Lancet criticizing Johnson’s plan to lift COVID-19 restrictions on July 19, calling the decision a “dangerous and unethical experiment,” according to The Guardian.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False The image has been digitally altered to include Wine. The original image shows Obama and the Argentinian ambassador to the U.S. in 2016. Fact Check: In the image, Obama and Wine look like they are posing for a photo in what appears to be the Oval Office of the White House. Wine wears a double-breasted suit with a red pocket square. (RELATED: Did Haitian President Jovenel Moise Say He Would Expose The Clinton Foundation The Day Before His Assassination?)   The picture, however, has been digitally altered, a reverse image search revealed. The original photo, found in a January 2016 Mendoza Post article, actually shows Obama standing with Argentina’s then-ambassador to the U.S Martín Lousteau. Wine has been digitally superimposed over Lousteau. While Check Your Fact was unable to identify the original source of the Wine photo, pictures of Wine wearing a similar suit can be found online. For example, he wore it in 2020 while wearing a face mask. He can also be seen wearing it in a photo published by The Standard. Social media users have previously spread false information about Wine and U.S. politicians. In December 2020, Check Your Fact debunked the claim that Obama and President Joe Biden tweeted “#FreeBobiWine” after Wine was arrested.

Verdict: False There is no evidence Moïse announced he would expose the Clinton Foundation. The claim appears to stem from a satirical article. Fact Check:   A team of gunmen assassinated Moïse and injured his wife in their home on July 7, the Associated Press reported. Now, an image on Facebook seemingly shows a screen grab of an article bearing the headline: “BREAKING: Haitian President Jovenel Moïse to expose Clinton Foundation fraud tomorrow.” Additional text in the image reads, “Last tuesday the president of Haiti told on msm he was gonna expose the Clinton Foundation, one day later he was dead….” Former president and then-U.N. Special Envoy to Haiti Bill Clinton and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were criticized for their performance in helping to lead recovery efforts after the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti which resulted in an estimated 220,000 deaths, according to BBC News. The Clinton Foundation drew criticism and accusations of corruption related to its involvement in aid work and funding following the disaster, the outlet reported. There is no record of Moïse telling the media he planned to reveal fraud perpetrated by the Clinton Foundation. None of the Haitian Ministry of Communication’s 2021 press releases mention the Clinton Foundation. Nor do any of Moïse’s social media posts. An internet search turned up no media reports of Moïse ever saying he was planning to “expose” the Clinton Foundation. Moïse met and spoke with Bill Clinton in September 2018 during the Bloomberg Global Business Forum in New York, and tweeted that the exchange was “a pleasure.” (RELATED: Did Haiti’s First Lady Martine Moïse Die?)  The screen grabbed article in the Facebook post appears to stem from an article published on the Genesius Times, a website that describes itself as, “The most reliable source of fake news on the planet.” While the Genesius Times clearly disclaims that the articles on its website are not factual, some social media users have been sharing the claim without such a warning, passing the information off as genuine.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=272178751373056&id=100057427993205,https://apnews.com/article/haiti-president-jovenel-moise-killed-b56a0f8fec0832028bdc51e8d59c6af2,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37826098,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37826098,https://www.communication.gouv.ht/rubrique/communiques/,https://twitter.com/search?q=%22Clinton%20Foundation%22%20(from%3Amoisejovenel)&src=typed_query,https://www.facebook.com/page/1390429167954248/search/?q=Clinton%20Foundation,https://www.google.com/search?q=Jovenel+Mo%C3%AFse+Clinton+Foundation&ei=LZDvYICdIpWp5NoPv8K38AU&oq=Jovenel+Mo%C3%AFse+Clinton+Foundation&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBQghEKsCSgQIQRgBUOkFWJYdYKYiaAFwAHgAgAFviAGaA5IBAzUuMZgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwjA5-yN9-PxAhWVFFkFHT_hDV4Q4dUDCA4&uact=5,https://twitter.com/moisejovenel/status/1044988661195051010,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/07/12/fact-check-haiti-first-lady-martine-moise-die/,https://genesiustimes.com/haitian-president-jovenel-moise-to-expose-clinton-foundation-fraud-tomorrow/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#01757364776e7341626964626a786e7473676062752f626e6c",Did Haitian President Jovenel Moïse Say He Would Expose The Clinton Foundation The Day Before His Assassination?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The video, which dates back to 2017, shows Venezuelan protesters being hit with a water cannon. Fact Check:   The 18-second video shows a group of protesters, some wearing helmets and carrying shields, being blasted and scattered by a water cannon from a nearby armored vehicle. The caption reads, “A water cannon for riots in South Africa.” Rioting and looting recently broke out in parts of South Africa after former President Jacob Zuma started serving his 15-month jail sentence for contempt of court, according to The Wall Street Journal. The South African military has been deployed to quell the unrest that has left over 70 dead, according to CNN. While water cannons have, according to Eyewitness News and News24, reportedly been used on protesters in South Africa, the video was not taken during the current unrest there. The video dates back to at least 2017, with it being posted on Twitter with a caption indicating it was filmed in Venezuela.  Rioters vs. Watercanons 😳Venezuelan protesters are cleaned up by a water cannon from China as artillery for the violent anti-gov riots! pic.twitter.com/3zJGP0y57B — IFL Fighting (@IFLfighting) May 16, 2017   “Rioters vs. Watercanons (sic),” reads the tweet’s caption. “Venezuelan protesters are cleaned up by a water cannon from China as artillery for the violent anti-gov riots!” The version of the video in the 2017 tweet contains a watermark for the video-sharing website LiveLeak. LiveLeak has since shut down, according to The Verge. (RELATED: Are White South Africans Banned From Receiving Government Aid During The COVID-19 Pandemic?) AFP News Agency posted a different angle of the same incident on YouTube in May 2017, with the description saying, “Clashes erupted Wednesday between riot police and opposition protesters in Caracas, as 3,000 protesters headed for the Supreme Court, whose bid on April 1 to strengthen Maduro’s grip on power by stripping authority from the legislature launched a wave of protests and deadly unrest.”  if(dc_showing_ads) { var scr = document.createElement('script'); scr.async= true; scr.src = ""https://get.civicscience.com/jspoll/5/csw-polyfills.js""; document.getElementsByTagName(""body"")[0].appendChild(scr); } Venezuelans had frequent demonstrations across the country in protest of President Nicolas Maduro and his government in 2017, according to The Atlantic. Over 100 people in Venezuela died in four months amid the anti-government protests, BBC News reported that year. In the video of the protesters being hit with a water cannon, at least one of them is carrying a shield decorated with the colors of the Venezuelan flag: yellow, blue and red. Images and videos from the 2017 Venezuelan protests show extremely similar interactions between protesters and authorities with water cannons. For instance, protesters carrying shields can be seen squaring off against the white armored vehicles of the Venezuelan National Guard in one video shared on YouTube by the Russian video news agency Ruptly.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no evidence that $34 quintillion in gold has been taken from the Vatican to be given to “the people.” Fact Check:   “Breaking News! The $34 Quintillion in gold seized from the Vatican is being distributed to the people globally,” the Facebook post reads, citing “CBK” as its source. CBK appears to stand for “Caroline Bisset (sic) Kennedy,” according to another Facebook post shared by the user. Caroline Kennedy died alongside her husband, John F. Kennedy Jr., in a plane crash in 1999 off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, according to the New York Times. (RELATED: Was Pope Francis Arrested On Charges Including Human Trafficking And Fraud) There is, however, no evidence that $34 quintillion in gold was seized from the Vatican and will be distributed globally. A search of press releases from the Vatican, as well as the Vatican News website turned up no reports of gold being seized. Had such a large sum of gold been seized with plans to distribute to the mass public, major media outlets certainly would have reported on it, yet none have. “The claim is false,” Fr. Roger Landry, an attaché to the Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy See to the United Nations, said in an email to Check Your Fact. “A quintillion is a billion billions and there’s not even that much gold, not to mention money, in the world.”  The Vatican’s net assets in 2019 were worth roughly 4 billion euros, or about 4.7 billion U.S. dollars, not including the Vatican bank or the Vatican museums, according to Reuters. The Vatican bank had $20 million in gold reserves held at the U.S. Federal Reserve, and managed $64 billion worth of assets from its customers, NASDAQ reported in 2015.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsRyan KingContributor","https://www.facebook.com/star.aquarius.731/posts/4380189458712485,https://www.facebook.com/star.aquarius.731/posts/4305472406184191,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/22/us/bodies-from-kennedy-crash-are-found.html,https://checkyourfact.com/2021/01/12/fact-check-pope-indicted-charges-child-trafficking-fraud/,https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/ricerca.html?date=2021&q=gold,https://www.vaticannews.va/en/search.html?q=gold&in=all&sorting=latest,https://www.google.com/search?q=%2434+quintilian+gold+vatican&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS890US890&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjugIi7zOXxAhUgElkFHUgRCjcQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1440&bih=717,https://holyseemission.org/contents/mission/staff.php,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vatican-finances/vatican-releases-financial-figures-promises-transparency-idUSKBN26M5XD,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-much-money-does-vatican-have-2015-07-24",Was $34 Quintillion In Gold Seized From The Vatican?,,,,,,

Fact Check:  In recent days, Facebook and Twitter users have been sharing a photo of people seemingly protesting in front of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, claiming it shows a demonstration against “lockdown tyranny.” One iteration on Twitter has garnered over 7,000 likes to date. Amid spread of the Delta variant in the country, France recently announced that only those who have been vaccinated or tested negative for COVID-19 will be permitted in certain venues such as restaurants, bars, malls, trains and theaters starting in August, The Wall Street Journal reported. Those announced COVID-19 restrictions prompted protests in several French cities, according to EuroNews. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact discovered the photo predates the COVID-19 pandemic. The Daily Mail published the picture, credited to photographer Olivier Coret, in a November 2018 article about yellow vest protests in France. The yellow vest protests, named after the safety jackets worn by many demonstrators, came after French President Emmanuel Macron announced a green tax on diesel fuel in late 2018, according to NPR.  The photo in question can also be found on Divergence Images, where it is attributed to Coret and described as showing a “demonstration of the Yellow Vests on the Champs-Elysees, Paris on November 24, 2018,” according to a Google translation. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show An Anti-Communist Protest In Cuba?) In addition to protesting the diesel fuel green tax, the yellow vest protesters also called for things such as an increase in minimum wage, NPR reported. In early December 2018, the French government scrapped the added green tax on fuel before it was supposed to go into effect, according to the Associated Press.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The photo actually shows a 2013 May Day parade that is unrelated to recent Cuban anti-government protests. Fact Check:   Demonstrations against Cuba’s Communist-run government started in the country July 11, with thousands of Cubans decrying price increases, the government’s COVID-19 response and food and medicine shortages, BBC News reported. Many protesters have called for Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel’s resignation, according to CNN. The picture in the July 13 Facebook post shows a huge crowd stretching down Avenida Paseo in the Cuban capital city of Havana. The caption reads, “C U B A P R O T E S T I N G C O M M U N I S M.” (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Jill Biden Posing With Fidel Castro?) In reality, the pictured event took place over eight years ago and wasn’t held in protest against Cuba’s Communist-run government. The picture was taken in 2013 by a photographer for the Cuban government-controlled outlet CubaDebate, which reported that it shows a May Day parade on May 1 of that year. Other photos of the same parade can be found on Getty Images. Cuba’s then-President Raul Castro attended the 2013 May Day march in Havana, with participants holding pictures of him, former President Fidel Castro, and socialist former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, Reuters reported. May Day is also known as International Workers’ Day and has long been celebrated by communists, socialists and labor movements, according to NBC Chicago.  Amid the widespread protests this week, the Cuban government shut off access to social media and messaging apps in the country on July 12, with service interruptions occurring into July 14, the Miami Herald reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10226115540379600&set=a.1095088542014&type=3&theater,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-57830160,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/11/americas/cuba-protests/index.html,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10226115540379600&set=a.1095088542014&type=3&theater,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jos%C3%A9+Mart%C3%AD+Memorial/@23.1255174,-82.3897591,664m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x88cd79e1bd4e654b:0x2f4cd3720557f2ad!8m2!3d23.1229226!4d-82.3864972,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/09/07/fact-check-jill-biden-fidel-castro-jacqueline-beer/,https://web.archive.org/web/20210214074729/http://www.cubadebate.cu/noticias/2013/05/01/presidente-cubano-raul-castro-lidera-marcha-por-el-primero-de-mayo/,https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/cuba-may-day-parade-2013?agreements=pa%253A114372%252Ced%253A7788&family=editorial&phrase=cuba%2520may%2520day%2520parade%25202013&sort=best,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-cuba-mayday/on-may-day-cuba-remembers-best-friend-chavez-idUKBRE9400L620130501,https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/good-question-may-day/1872684/,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article252781053.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#75010710031a0735161d10161e0c1a0007131416015b161a18",Does This Photo Show An Anti-Communist Protest In Cuba?,,,,,,

Verdict: False The video, which was taken in 2017, actually shows animals running freely in Kruger National Park. The video is unrelated to the ongoing protests in South Africa. Fact Check:   The 20-second video shows a police vehicle on a road with several wild dogs, when suddenly an elephant emerges from the brush, chasing some of them away. “Free Zuma protesters free wild animals from the Hluhluwe Game Reserve in Kwazulu Natal by cutting the fence,” reads the video’s caption. At least 72 people have been killed in South Africa from rioting and looting in recent days prompted by the jailing of former South African President Jacob Zuma, CNN reported. Zuma was sentenced to 15 months in prison for contempt after he failed to appear in front of a commission investigating accusations of corruption, according to The New York Times. The Facebook video does not, however, show the actions of protesters. Had South African protesters released wild animals, media outlets certainly would have reported on it, yet none have. Check Your Fact found the same footage posted on YouTube in July 2017, years before Zuma’s jailing, with the title: “Elephant Shows Wild Dogs & the Police Who’s Boss.” The video was posted by the verified YouTube channel Latest Sightings, which posts videos of “authentic wildlife videos coming from around Africa,” according to its “About” section.  The footage was shot by  61-year-old Beryl Venter in South Africa’s Kruger National Park, not Hluhluwe Game Reserve, according to the video’s description. (RELATED: Are White South Africans Banned From Receiving Government Aid During The COVID-19 Pandemic?) “We were on our way home from Letaba after a five-week stay in Kruger – feeling very depressed and not expecting any ‘wow’ sightings,” Venter told Latest Sightings. “We were then suddenly very excited to see the wild dogs running around and playing in the road – twenty-one of them.

Verdict: Misleading The image shows abandoned electric cars in China, not France. Fact Check:   The viral image shows what appears to be hundreds of the same, small car abandoned in a grassy field. “Electric car cemetery in France,” reads the image’s caption. “Turns out no one wants to buy an electric car once the battery is shot.” The image was not, however, taken in France. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found similar photos featured in an April 2019 article published by Shanghaiist with the headline: “LOOK: Hundreds of electric cars rust away at ‘shared car graveyard’ in Hangzhou.” The article explained the cars belonged to Microcity, a Chinese electric car rental company. Microcity reportedly claimed the cars were still in use despite users saying they were unable to locate nearby vehicles through the app, Abacus reported in March 2019. (RELATED: Did Ocasio-Cortez Tweet About Electric Cars During Hurricane Dorian?) The same images were shared on the Chinese news website NetEase News with captions that also identify the location as Hangzhou, China. Several landmarks in these photos match with those found in the image shared on Facebook, confirming the locations are the same.  Hundreds of ride-sharing companies, including Microcity, opened in China in the late 2010s, a phenomenon driven in part by popularity of the industry and the abundance of electric vehicles in China, according to Abacus. Many of these companies faced economic hardship in the following years, the outlet reported. A similar photo showing a field of cars in France previously circulated on Facebook, claiming the cars had been abandoned due to their batteries no longer working. Reuters debunked the claim, saying the abandoned car lot was due to a company’s contract ending, not faulty batteries.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no evidence Wine owns a mansion in Boston. He was digitally added to the photo, which actually shows a mansion in Tampa, Florida. Fact Check:   Wine, a singer-turned-politician, lost the 2021 Ugandan presidential election to long-time President Yoweri Museveni, CNN reported. Wine asserted there was widespread fraud in the election and filed a lawsuit, which he later withdrew, to over-turn Museveni’s victory, according to Al Jazeera. An image on Facebook claims to show Wine standing in front of a mansion he allegedly purchased in Boston. “Uganda’s musician turned politician Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine has bought a luxurious Bungalow, Cottage located in 20 Ford St, Boston, MA 02128 in USA,” reads the image’s caption. The image, however, has been digitally altered. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found the photo of the house without Wine in front of it, on the real estate website Zillow. The home is located in Tampa, Florida, not Boston, and was last sold in 2018, according to its listing. (RELATED: Did The BBC Air This Chyron Reporting Bobi Wine Will Be Sworn In As Uganda’s President?) A search for the address listed in the post turned up a home for sale in Boston. Photos of the house included in the listing show it does not resemble the house in the Facebook post. Check Your Fact searched Suffolk County’s registry of deeds, but found no records of Wine owning property in Boston.  Wine was in the city in early July to meet his “diaspora leadership team,” according to a July 3 tweet he posted.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False There is no record of BBC News publishing this article about Radiohead fans. It appears to have originated from a Twitter account that often posts satirical content. Fact Check: The image shows what looks like a BBC News article that puts up the headline “Radiohead crowd left red-faced after applauding three minute guitar tuning, mistaking it for new song.” Radiohead is a popular British rock band known for songs such as “Creep” and “Karma Police.” The supposed article places the alleged Radiohead fan incident at a Glastonbury Festival.   A search of the BBC News website didn’t turn up any articles with titles matching the one in the Facebook post. Unlike stories published online by BBC News, the alleged Radiohead article doesn’t have a byline, indicating it has been fabricated. A BBC spokesperson confirmed to Check Your Fact in an email that it is fake. In 2017, a real BBC News article described Radiohead’s performance at the Glastonbury Festival that year as “absorbing, challenging and achingly beautiful.” (RELATED: Did Kurt Cobain Predict Trump’s Presidency?) The fabricated Radiohead article first went viral back in 2017, according to NME. It appears to have originated from the Twitter account of the London-based flower delivery company Arena Flowers, which tweeted the fake article June 23, 2017. The Twitter account @ArenaFlowers has previously published seemingly satirical fake BBC News articles, including one about singer Ed Sheeran playing on every Glastonbury stage at the same time using mirrors.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The image actually shows a 2011 protest in Alexandria, Egypt. Fact Check:   Amid widespread anti-government protests in Cuba, social media users have been sharing a photo that shows thousands of people gathered in a street. One such July 12 Facebook post claims in the caption that the picture shows Cubans protesting “today.” However, a closer examination of the photo indicates it does not depict an anti-government demonstration that recently occurred in Cuba. Multiple protesters in the picture appear to be waving flags that resemble those of Egypt, Yemen or Syria rather than Cuba. (RELATED: Image Claims To Show Cuban Farmer Before Being Executed For Refusing To Work For The Castro Regime) Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found the picture in a 2012 article from TheJournal.ie that discusses the 2011 Arab Spring uprising in Egypt. The caption for the photo in TheJournal.ie article states it was taken in the Egyptian city of Alexandria in February 2011 and credits it to the Associated Press and Tarek Fawzy. What appears to be a higher resolution version of the photo can be found on AP Images. The caption for the picture on AP Images confirms it was taken in Egypt over a decade ago during an anti-government protest against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, not during a demonstration in Cuba this month.  “Thousands of Egyptian anti-government protesters march in Alexandria, Egypt, Friday, Feb. 11, 2011,” reads the caption. “Mubarak has refused to step down or leave the country, and instead handed his administrative powers to his vice president Omar Suleiman on Thursday, remaining president and ensuring control over the reform process, prompting mass protests by anti-Mubarak demonstrators.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsRyan KingContributor","https://www.facebook.com/303371154019205/posts/549288262760825,https://wsj.com/articles/cuba-protests-whats-happening-11626112390,https://www.facebook.com/303371154019205/posts/549288262760825,https://www.britannica.com/topic/flag-of-Egypt,https://www.britannica.com/topic/flag-of-Yemen,https://www.britannica.com/topic/flag-of-Syria,https://www.britannica.com/topic/flag-of-Cuba,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/09/10/fact-check-cuban-farmer-executed-castro-regime/,https://www.thejournal.ie/timeline-one-year-since-egypts-arab-spring-334766-Jan2012/#slide-slideshow15,https://www.history.com/topics/middle-east/arab-spring,https://www.thejournal.ie/timeline-one-year-since-egypts-arab-spring-334766-Jan2012/#slide-slideshow15,http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/Mideast-Egypt/a989c47b844c4a319ab711ee47f7aa3d/62/0,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hosni-Mubarak,http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/Mideast-Egypt/a989c47b844c4a319ab711ee47f7aa3d/62/0",Does This Photo Show A July 12 Protest In Cuba?,,,,,,

The skeleton of this giant was discovered in November 2017 in a cave in Krabi, Thailand. This was just made public a few months ago. The skeleton appeared to have been battling a large horned serpent upon death. pic.twitter.com/p5u8KEYWGC — Untold Universe (@UniverseUntold) June 13, 2021  Verdict: False The image actually shows an art installation created by a Taiwanese artist. Fact Check:   The tweet has garnered over 100 likes as of press time. It features a photo of a woman standing above what appears to be an archeological site in which a giant humanoid skeleton lies with a huge serpentine skeleton wrapped around it. “The skeleton of this giant was discovered in November 2017 in a cave in Krabi, Thailand,” reads the tweet. “This was just made public a few months ago. The skeleton appeared to have been battling a large horned serpent upon death.” Contrary to the tweet’s claim, the picture doesn’t show the actual remains of a giant that died battling a massive snake. Taiwan Today published a similar photo in a November 2018 article, explaining it shows Taiwanese artist Tu Wei-cheng’s “Giant Ruins” art installation for the Thailand Biennale exhibition in Krabi. The skeleton was made of plastic, and the installation received special permission to be set up in the cave, according to Taiwan Today. Another photo of Tu’s skeleton installation can be found on the Taiwanese Ministry of Culture’s website. (RELATED: Did A New York Artist Sell ‘Invisible Art’?)

Verdict: False Rhode’s accomplishments were widely covered in the media for more than a decade. She has several sponsors, according to her website. Fact Check:   The image shows Kim Rhode, an American double trap and skeet shooter and six-time Olympian, holding a shotgun. “First woman to medal in six straight Olympics media and sponsors ignore her because she is outspoken pro-2A,” reads text included in the image. Rhode won Olympic medals in 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016, making her the first female to win medals in six straight Olympics, according to the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee. (RELATED: Did American Runner Shelby Houlihan Test Positive For Marijuana?) Rhode is also an outspoken supporter of the Second Amendment, according to the National Rifle Association (NRA). She served on the NRA board from 2017 to 2020, according to Guns.com, and has spoken out against gun control initiatives in her home state of California on multiple occasions. News outlets and sponsors have not “ignored” Rhode for her stance on the Second Amendment. Rhode’s Olympic achievements have been thoroughly reported on over the years by major media outlets including: The New York Times, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times and the Associated Press, among others.  Rhode has also made several appearances on national television, such as Today and Fox News @ Night, according to her IMDb page. Her website states she is sponsored by Winchester Ammunition, Beretta USA, the Safari Club International and Truck Vault. In an interview with Time Magazine in August 2016, Rhode did say she believes her outspokenness about gun issues has prevented her from landing mainstream sponsors. She has also said there is a certain “stigma” around her sport because of its association with guns that makes some would-be sponsors wary, The Daily Signal reported. “When you look at the gun debate and the Olympics, there definitely is that stigmatism that’s attached to our sport due to all the negative publicity that guns get,” Rhode told The Daily Signal in 2016.  if(dc_showing_ads) { var scr = document.createElement('script'); scr.async= true; scr.src = ""https://get.civicscience.com/jspoll/5/csw-polyfills.js""; document.getElementsByTagName(""body"")[0].appendChild(scr); } Rhode did not qualify for the upcoming Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, NBC Sports reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsBrad SylvesterFact Check ReporterFollow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?
