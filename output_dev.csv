0;;;;False;Jessica Lee;2021-03-02;;snopes;https://www.snopes.com/author/jessicalee/;https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-2024-presidential-campaign/;In February 2021, former U.S. President Donald Trump launched a 2024 presidential campaign.;2021-03-02;snopes;;On Feb. 28, 2021, former U.S. President Donald Trump gave a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), marking his first major appearance since vacating the White House roughly six weeks earlier. Afterwards, some viewers interpreted his remarks to include an announcement of a 2024 presidential campaign following his loss to Democratic U.S. President Joe Biden in 2020.  Overall, Trump’s roughly 95-minute speech in Florida attacked Republicans who strayed from his political agenda, criticized Biden’s first few weeks in office, and perpetuated lies about the November 2020 election. Specifically, Trump attempted to convince the crowd that his opponents coordinated an illicit scheme to push him out of the White House — when, in reality, Biden secured the job because more Americans in battleground states voted for him instead of Trump. And mixed with the lies and vitriol were remarks that teased the possibility of a 2024 Trump presidential campaign. For example, after about 16 minutes on stage, the former president said, according to CSPAN’s video recording and a transcript of the event: “I may even decide to beat [Democrats] for a third time. Okay? For a third time.” At other points, he pointed to Biden’s track record as alleged evidence of Americans’ voting for a Republican candidate next election. “And I wonder who that will be,” he said. “Who, who, who will that be? I wonder.” Shortly after the speech, Trump told a reporter with Newsmax, a media outlet popular among his supporters, that while he doubts anyone could beat him if he decided to launch a presidential campaign again, “I haven’t decided to do that.”  In other words, Trump did not use the CPAC stage — nor any other platform — to announce plans to run in 2024, as of this writing. And in at least one interview he confirmed that he had not made up his mind on whether to place another bid for the White House. Furthermore, no email to supporters soliciting donations, merchandise on TrumpStore.com, or page on his official website said he was running again or advertised “Trump 2024” products. (Other retailers are selling such items, similarly to how his supporters are sporting “Patriot Party” memorabilia even though the Trump campaign attempted to distance itself from the name.) In sum, while his statements at the conference purposefully left the door open to the possibility of a 2024 Trump campaign, Trump did not officially announce one. For that reason, we rate this claim “False.”;https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-capitol-siege-donald-trump-florida-orlando-890c3b8d6b2ab4f9f29b0b36c03a304b,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/patriot-party-trump/,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/03/Copy-of-Rating-Overlay-Vertical-2-copy.png,https://www.snopes.com/collections/2020-election-collection/,https://www.c-span.org/video/?509084-1/president-trump-addresses-cpac&live,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cpac-2021-speech-transcript,https://twitter.com/newsmax/status/1366463667089399809?s=20,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-02-at-4.53.35-PM.png,https://www.donaldjtrump.com/,https://www.amazon.com/Trump-2024-T-Shirt-White-Republican/dp/B07N1J3MFV,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/antifa-patriot-party/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/patriot-party-trump/;Did Trump Launch 2024 Presidential Campaign?;donald trump, trump administration;;;;;
1;;;;What's False;Nur Ibrahim;2021-03-02;;snopes;https://www.snopes.com/author/nuribrahim/;https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/boston-schools-white-asian/;Boston Public Schools administrators suspended Advanced Work Classes, a selective program for high-performing students, because of concerns over racial inequities as the majority of the students enrolled were white or Asian.;2021-03-02;snopes;;In late February 2021, Superintendent Brenda Cassellius announced that new admissions for Advanced Work Classes (AWC), a selective program for high-performing fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-graders in Boston Public Schools (BPS), would be suspended for one year. The change generated more dramatic headlines, though, after reports emerged of alleged racial inequities within AWC. For example, a Daily Wire headline read, “Boston Public Schools Suspend Advanced Class Enrollment Test, Say Too Many Students In Them Are White Or Asian.” Many readers shared the story with us, asking if this suspension was on account of racial inequities and if the entire program was being suspended for the year. We learned that this was not entirely the case. First, the program itself was not suspended, only testing for new admissions. Students already in the program would continue classes, but no new students would be admitted for the year. BPS issued a notice on its website, explaining it was unable to administer the test also referred to as TerraNova: BPS added that this was only a one-year change to the program. The district also released a proposal outlining key changes in the program, including: “Launch a working group to look at long-term recommendations in light of declining demand and enrollment and equity consideration.” Students in the program are given the option to study subjects in more depth and are given more schoolwork than the traditional curriculum. The classes are available to all students who took the TerraNova test in the third grade and received a high score. Those students are placed in a lottery and the lottery winners are then invited to apply to the program.  The Daily Wire later updated its article with a correction: “This article has been revised to clarify that the admission test and new enrollments have been suspended but the program is being allowed to continue. It has also been updated to include the statement from Superintendent Brenda Cassellius provided to GBH after publication of its initial report.” GBH News also posted a clarification: “This story’s headline has been updated to clarify that the school district is suspending the city-wide entry process for Advanced Work classes, but is not prohibiting schools from continuing the classes on their own.” GBH News had initially reported that admissions for the program were being suspended on account of the COVID-19 pandemic and concerns about inequity. Following the story’s publication, Cassellius told GBH News that equity concerns were not the reason for the suspension of the test, but the pandemic made it impossible to administer the test. With that said, Cassellius’ initial remarks did acknowledge the troubling lack of diversity in the program. An analysis run by the district found that more than 70% of the students enrolled in the program were white or Asian, even though 80% of students in Boston’s public schools were Hispanic and Black. “There’s been a lot of inequities that have been brought to the light in the pandemic that we have to address,” Cassellius told GBH News. “There’s a lot of work we have to do in the district to be anti-racist and have policies where all of our students have a fair shot at an equitable and excellent education.” Given the clarifications issued by the superintendent and the corrections in the reporting around it, we rate this claim as “Mostly False.”;https://archive.li/AmQ1C#selection-2707.0-2732.0,https://archive.li/Mz7ze#selection-251.0-251.110,https://archive.li/AmQ1C#selection-2659.67-2659.288,https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/awc,https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/cms/lib/MA01906464/Centricity/Domain/162/Temporary%20Flexibility%20Policy%20Suspension.pdf,https://archive.li/AmQ1C,https://archive.li/Mz7ze#selection-347.0-350.0,https://archive.li/AmQ1C,https://archive.li/AmQ1C,https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/cms/lib/MA01906464/Centricity/Domain/162/Temporary%20Flexibility%20Policy%20Suspension.pdf,https://archive.li/AmQ1C,https://archive.li/AmQ1C;Are Boston Public Schools Suspending Advanced Classes Because of Too Many White and Asian Students?;COVID-19;;;;;

It featured a purported German children’s story titled “Little Suck-a-Thumb.”   The video began with one of the men saying: “As Germans, we are naturally very funny.” The other chimed in with: “We’re raised with hilarious children’s stories like ‘Little Suck-a-Thumb.'” The pair acted out a story where a mother tells a child to not suck his thumb. She tells him if he continues to do so, a tall tailor will cut it off. The mother leaves the room. Next, the tall tailor arrives and cuts off the child’s thumb. This is a tale from a real German children’s book titled “Der Struwwelpeter.” It was first published in 1845 and featured 10 stories written and illustrated by Heinrich Hoffmann. It is available for reading on the Virginia Commonwealth University website. After the mother warns the boy, the “great tall tailor” arrives with his “great sharp scissors”: The book page was also reposted on Pinterest:  In recent years, the strange tale has made its way into American popular culture. For example, there was this sequence from the cartoon TV series “Family Guy.” In the clip, the mother cuts off the child’s thumbs: Dwight Schrute, a character on the American version of “The Office,” also brought up “Little Suck-a-Thumb.” The moment appeared during Season 2, Episode 18. The episode’s title was “Take Your Daughter to Work Day.” Schrute’s character changed the tale for the little girls present in the room: Dover Publications included a brief history of the book after it republished the tales in 1995: In sum, “Little Suck-a-Thumb” was a story that appeared in a real German children’s book.;https://www.tiktok.com/@calvinandhabs/video/6934836493898878213,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/lw82pg/german_comedy/,https://www.amazon.com/Struwwelpeter-English-Translation-Childrens-Classics/dp/0486284697,https://www.kqed.org/arts/13863411/how-one-brutal-childrens-book-from-1845-left-permanent-marks-on-pop-culture,https://germanstories.vcu.edu/struwwel/daumen_e.html,https://www.pinterest.com/pin/448811919088586775/,https://www.pinterest.com/pin/448811919088586775/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khOIOHcw4PI,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/tiktok-zombies-finland/;Is ‘Little Suck-a-Thumb’ from a Real German Children’s Book?;TikTok Rumors;;;;;
3;;;;False;Alex Kasprak;2021-03-02;;snopes;https://www.snopes.com/author/alex/;https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/austin-285m-contracts/;Under the leadership of U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin in 2021, the department approved military contracts for a company Austin contemporaneously owned stocks in.;2021-03-02;snopes;;This article has been updated and its rating has been changed from “True” to “False.” Following initial publication, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby provided us with this statement: “By prior arrangement, Secretary Austin divested his entire Raytheon portfolio on Jan. 22, 2021, immediately following the Senate vote confirming him as the new Secretary of Defense.” Snopes initially received no comment on a Feb. 24, 2021 inquiry about his divestment from Raytheon, and as such, our initial article relied on a divestment timeline provided by Secretary Austin in filings with the Office of Government Ethics. On Feb. 19, 2021, an identically phrased claim went viral on multiple social media accounts, including that of a sitting congressman, after it was posted by a self-described MAGA “global recruiter” with the Twitter handle “@johnnyrwhitsett.” The claim references an alleged $285 million defense contract awarded to a company that U.S. President Joe Biden’s secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, “owns over [$1 million] of stock in.”   The memes are referring to Austin’s past financial interest in the military contractor Raytheon. While Austin served on the Board of Directors of Raytheon and once held shares in the company given to him through executive compensation, the statement that he was invested in the company during the time he was in office is, according to Pentagon Spokesperson John Kirby, false. The specific monetary value in these memes appears to have their origin in a viral Feb. 17 YouTube video that — despite discussing the value “85 million” in the actual clip — was shared by its creator with the higher number on Twitter. That video derived the number $85 million from an announcement by the State Department — which does not award defense contracts — approving a proposed sale of missiles produced by the company Raytheon to the government of Chile. Austin’s divestment aside, senators have raised concerns over the close relationship between Raytheon and Austin in general. In correspondence with U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Austin pledged to “extend his recusal from Raytheon Technologies for four years and to not seek a position on the board of a defense contractor or become a lobbyist after his government service.” It bears mentioning that Mark Esper, who served as former President Donald Trump’s secretary of defense, served as Raytheon’s vice president of government relations directly before his confirmation. When asked by Warren during his confirmation hearing if he would recuse himself from decisions involving Raytheon, he refused. From 2016 to the day of his confirmation as secretary of defense on Jan. 22, 2021, Austin served on the Board of Directors for Raytheon or a company, United Technologies Corp, that would merge with it. Prior to his confirmation, according to documents filed with the Office of Government Ethics, Austin held “vested deferred stock units and vested and unvested restricted stock units” in Raytheon. These are special forms of stock-based executive compensation. Deferred stock units are shares inaccessible to the owner until after that person has left the company. Restricted stocks are ownership shares of a company subject to special Securities and Exchange (SEC) restrictions intended, among other things, to prevent premature selling. Both options are often given on a vesting schedule, meaning that the full amount of the stock compensation is not available to that executive (i.e., it remains unvested) until the executive has worked at the company for a certain period of time. Austin sold these stocks the day of his confirmation. In his White House financial disclosure form, Austin indicated the value of his vested deferred stocks to be between $500,000 and $1,000,000 and the value of his vested restricted stocks to be between $50,000 and $100,000. Austin, a DOD spokesperson told us, “will file a Periodic Transaction Report and a Certificate of Ethics Agreement Compliance which will both be publicly available on the OGE website.” Raytheon performs a prodigious amount of work for the Department of Defense. Based on an analysis performed by Snopes, in the first month that Austin served as its secretary, the DOD granted at least $569,756,040 in new contracts or contract modifications to Raytheon or various divisions of Raytheon branches: As part of Austin’s ethics pledge, he stated that he would “not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter that to my knowledge has a direct and predictable effect on the financial interests of Raytheon.” We asked the DOD how this arrangement would work, given the large volume of business conducted with Raytheon. In response, a spokesperson told us: Because Austin divested entirely from Raytheon prior to any contract being awarded to the company under his leadership, the claim is “False.”;https://archive.vn/7nFLW,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/03/285m-tweets.png,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W7EL2BzctI,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-chile-arms/u-s-state-department-approves-first-potential-weapons-sales-under-biden-says-pentagon-idUSKBN2A52MC,https://www.state.gov/u-s-arms-sales-and-defense-trade/,https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/in-response-to-senator-warrens-questions-secretary-of-defense-nominee-general-lloyd-austin-commits-to-recusing-himself-from-raytheon-decisions-for-four-years,http://investor.raytheon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/raytheon-names-mark-t-esper-vice-president-government-relations,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/07/16/esper-refuses-recuse-himself-raytheon-matters-secdef-confirmation-hearing.html,https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2020/03/27/raytheon-utc-look-to-shed-segments-to-win-merger-approval/,https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/BABBC4FC26731BB6852586590031768F/%24FILE/Austin,%20Lloyd%20%20final278.pdf,https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/58BAB511BDEEC1438525865900317E1F/%24FILE/Austin,%20Lloyd%20%20finalEA.pdf,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredshare.asp,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restrictedstock.asp,https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/BABBC4FC26731BB6852586590031768F/%24FILE/Austin,%20Lloyd%20%20final278.pdf,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lr-rbOiGHXSI9Jy0tNItEto2XG6hYo89USx6qWiEDiM/edit#gid=1299894354,https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/58BAB511BDEEC1438525865900317E1F/%24FILE/Austin,%20Lloyd%20%20finalEA.pdf;Did Lloyd Austin’s DOD Approve Contracts for a Company He Owns Stocks in?;Editor's Picks;;;;;

In celebration of the “Green Eggs and Ham” author and his contributions to children’s literacy, the date has long been tied to “Read Across America Day,” a National Education Association (NEA) day dedicated to encouraging children to read. That started to change in recent years when the NEA began pushing for the day to focus more on diverse children’s book authors, and also with discussion of racist depictions of characters in some of Dr. Seuss’ works. In 2021, on what would be the author’s 117th birthday, those circumstances — along with false claims that a school district in Virginia banned Dr. Seuss books and a brewing conservative backlash over “cancel culture” — came together in a digital Big Bang of internet outrage, with some claiming Dr. Seuss had been “canceled” by the woke left. Here’s what we know: On March 2, 2021, when U.S. President Joe Biden made his proclamation recognizing Read Across America Day 2021, many conservative news outlets reported he did so without mentioning Dr. Seuss by name. “Biden removes mention of Dr. Seuss from Read Across America Day,” a New York Post headline read. Other right-leaning news outlets echoed that narrative. Biden’s two predecessors, former presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, both issued proclamations recognizing the national reading day while also commemorating Dr. Seuss by name, while Bill Clinton honored Dr. Seuss in recorded remarks made for broadcast. But movement away from linking Dr. Seuss’ work to Read Across America Day began before January 2021, when Biden took office. As USA Today reported, since the national reading day’s inception in 1998 until 2018, the NEA had partnered with Dr. Seuss Enterprises, the organization tasked with preserving the author’s legacy. But in 2017, the NEA announced it would begin moving in a different direction in favor of promoting diverse children’s books. The announcement coincided with discussions over racist imagery and language found in Seuss’ body of work. A 2019 study by the Conscious Kid’s Library and University of California San Diego said that the vast majority of human characters in Dr. Seuss’ books are white, and non-white characters were portrayed in an offensive manner. Dr. Seuss Enterprises announced on March 2, 2021, that it would take the step of no longer publishing six of the author’s books because they contain racist imagery. “Ceasing sales of these books is only part of our commitment and our broader plan to ensure Dr. Seuss Enterprises’s catalog represents and supports all communities and families,” the announcement stated. Adding to the kerfuffle, the public school district in Loudoun County, Virginia, was forced to release a statement to counter false rumors that Dr. Seuss’ books had been banned by the district. Although the district will no longer make Dr. Seuss books the focus of its Read Across America Day activities, the authors works “have not been banned and are available to students in our libraries and classrooms,” the districted stated.;https://archive.is/OsjFK,https://twitter.com/ACTBrigitte/status/1366644978798260227,https://archive.is/MtpeH#selection-769.5-774.0,https://archive.is/xNPPC#selection-1167.0-1170.0,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/radio-remarks-read-across-america-day-0,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2021/03/01/read-across-america-day-dr-seuss-diversity-racism/6878454002/,https://www.slj.com/?detailStory=cat-hat-racist-read-across-america-shifts-away-dr-seuss-toward-diverse-books,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dr-seuss-racist-cartoons/,https://sophia.stkate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1050&context=rdyl,https://apnews.com/article/dr-seuss-books-racist-images-d8ed18335c03319d72f443594c174513,https://www.seussville.com/statement-from-dr-seuss-enterprises/,https://www.lcps.org/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID=1&ModuleInstanceID=274904&ViewID=6446EE88-D30C-497E-9316-3F8874B3E108&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=401332&PageID=1,https://archive.is/OsjFK;Did Biden ‘Erase’ Dr. Seuss From Read Across America Day?;Dr. Seuss, Joe Biden;;;;;

The caption of the ad may have led readers to believe that the plane was about to hit the train. It said: “17 Airports With the Most Dangerous Landings in the World.” It had all the makings of being a misleading photo. First, it was in an online ad, which often is not the most reliable source of facts. The shadows looked too perfect. The light was bright and sunny. The grass was green and pretty. Perhaps it was from a flight simulation video game? However, the photograph is real. The simple truth is that New Zealand is just a beautiful country. It was photographed at Gisborne Airport in Gisborne. Reddit user u/tuneznz posted the picture to r/aviation and Imgur in 2013:   We contacted u/tuneznz, who told us where we could find more information. A caption appeared on page 19 in a 2014 issue of Vector magazine, a publication about aviation: “A Grumman TBF Avenger waits on runway 32 while Gisborne City Vintage Railway’s train, headed by the 1897 locomotive WA 165 crosses in its path. Gisborne Aviation Preservation Society Open Day. 2 June 2013.” The airplane in the photograph was not in motion at the time. Reddit user u/tuneznz told us it was parked with wheel chocks. The 2014 story from Vector shed light on the history of Gisborne: According to u/tuneznz, the photograph rights appeared to belong to The Gisborne Herald, a New Zealand publication.  The original advertisement led to a Forbes story about airports where it may be dangerous to land aircraft.  In sum, a picture of a train crossing in front of an airplane on a runway was real.

And some social media users speculated that the American multinational e-commerce company promptly switched its redesign to counter online criticism, including The Guardian technology editor Alex Hern.  The new icon for the application launched in the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands on iOS on Jan. 25 and worldwide on iOS on Feb 22. On Android, the icon launched on March 1. But the icon in question was in select countries, and according to an Amazon spokesperson, the company made changes to the original design based on customer feedback before it was rolled out worldwide. Amazon did not directly comment on whether the change was spurred by online comparisons to Hitler’s mustache. Instead, a spokesperson sent Snopes the below comment: “Amazon is always exploring new ways to delight our customers,” they said. “We designed the new icon to spark anticipation, excitement, and joy when customers start their shopping journey on their phone, just as they do when they see our boxes on their doorstep.” This is the first update to the global mobile icon in more than five years and will be visible to customers once their phone applications are updated. It joins new functional updates to the app, including a new bottom navigation, simplified top navigation, and a new color scheme. “The mobile app icon is designed to be instantly recognizable to our customers around the world,” Amazon told Snopes in an email. “The new design features a brown delivery package and a hint of tape as the backdrop for the Amazon smile, which is now recognized around the world.”;;Did Amazon Change Logo After Users Compared It to Hitler’s Mustache?;amazon;;;;;

For example, Arab News, a Saudi-based, English-language daily newspaper, said snow covered Tabuk’s mountains on Feb. 18 after plunging overnight temperatures, and officials issued extreme-weather warnings for the city and other regions across Saudi Arabia. “There is no one denying climate change, but it’s also not that rare for this region — Tabuk, in northwestern Saudi Arabia — to experience snow,” said Fahad Nazar, the spokesperson for Saudi Arabian embassy in Washington, D.C., according to the news outlet. “Contrary to popular perception, not every region in the Kingdom is warm year-round.” Additionally, an English news story by Alarabiya News, a Dubai-based television news outlet, reported similar information around the same time: The official Twitter accounts for Al Arabiya English and Arab News shared the above-mentioned viral video of the camels in the snow.;https://www.facebook.com/100000057996153/posts/5356995077645706/,https://www.britannica.com/place/Arabian-Desert,https://twitter.com/B_KH_H/status/1362169933552115712,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-02-at-12.28.56-PM.png,https://www.arabnews.com/node/1811811/saudi-arabia,https://www.arabnews.com/node/1811811/saudi-arabia,https://www.arabnews.com/node/1810651/saudi-arabia,https://english.alarabiya.net/life-style/travel-and-tourism/2021/02/18/Saudi-Arabia-s-Tabuk-begins-to-see-snowfall-as-Kingdom-expects-weekend-thunderstorms,https://twitter.com/AlArabiya_Eng/status/1362212456584654855?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1362212456584654855%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fenglish.alarabiya.net%2Flife-style%2Ftravel-and-tourism%2F2021%2F02%2F18%2FSaudi-Arabia-s-Tabuk-begins-to-see-snowfall-as-Kingdom-expects-weekend-thunderstorms,https://twitter.com/arabnews/status/1362303573711720449;Does This Video Show Heavy Snowfall in Arabian Desert?;;;;;;

But that legacy is under fire. On Read Across America Day on March 2, 2021— which is also Dr. Seuss’ birthday — the business that preserves his legacy announced that six of his children’s books would no longer be published due to their offensive and racist content. Some schools also sought to de-emphasize studying his work on that day because of its racial undertones. Dr. Seuss also had a history of creating cartoons featuring racist propaganda, and offensive caricatures of Black people, Asians, and Arabs. Twitter users shared the following cartoons of Black people depicted in an offensive and racist style. We learned that these were indeed created by Dr. Seuss around the time he was creating advertisements and comics as an illustrator.   The top two images portraying Black people in advertisements for Flit, a brand of insect repellant, were created between 1930 and 1940. They are available for download (here and here) in the University of California, San Diego’s digital library collection. The cartoon portraying Black people for sale in a department store was made by Dr. Seuss in 1929 for “Judge” magazine, and was part of a larger comics panel titled, ”Cross-Section of The World’s Most Prosperous Department Store.” The full comic is visible below.  This particular comic was auctioned in 2015 by Los Angeles-based Nate D. Sanders Fine Autographs and Memorabilia, an auction house known for selling Hollywood memorabilia, and more. The auction house did not reveal the names of the seller or the buyer. Their website carried a more detailed description of the image: Given that these are authenticated images from UC San Diego and a prominent auction house, we rate this claim as “True.”;https://www.businessinsider.com/before-dr-seuss-was-famous-he-drew-these-sad-racist-ads-2012-3,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2021/03/02/6-dr-seuss-books-wont-be-published-for-racist-images/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dr-seuss-canceled/,https://www.businessinsider.com/before-dr-seuss-was-famous-he-drew-these-sad-racist-ads-2012-3,https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/object/bb7475442t,https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/object/bb7782613z,https://natedsanders.com/LotDetail.aspx?inventoryid=36654,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-02-at-12.44.56-PM.png,https://natedsanders.com/UserFiles/Image/Orson%20Welles_Citizen%20Kane_Oscar%20brings%20%24861,000.png,https://natedsanders.com/LotDetail.aspx?inventoryid=36654;Did Dr. Seuss Draw Racist Cartoons?;;;;;;

We initially were unable to track down some of the misleading pages that featured these claims. Now, we know why. We’ll begin with actor Tom Selleck and the claim that CBD oil was his “latest business venture.” The first step in the creation of the strange rabbit hole began with a Google advertisement just like this one. It read: “Tom ‘Removed’ from ‘Blue Bloods.'”  As we previously reported, there was no truth to this rumor. Once readers clicked the Google ad, they were led to the second step of the scheme. After following the ad, a specialized page loaded on the travel-alive.myshopify.com website. We have uploaded a PDF of the page for readers to view. It mentioned nothing about “Blue Bloods.” The page featured Selleck and a purported sales pitch for CBD oil products. The headline, purportedly in Time magazine, read: “Tom Selleck’s Latest Business Venture Sparks Tension With CBS and Big Pharma – He Fires Back With This!” This was not true. It appeared to all be fabricated. Selleck was not a spokesperson for CBD oil products. Further, Time magazine had no involvement with any of this. There was also no indication that People magazine or other big-name publishers had involvement. Drew Carey, Tom Hanks, Randy Jackson, and Halle Berry also purportedly gave testimonials for the Prime Nature CBD product. However, those were also misleading and fake. We previously reported about the late Alex Trebek and his likeness being misused on CBD oil websites, as well. The celebrity page featured links to supposedly purchase the products Vytalize and Northern Sense CBD Oil, plus perhaps others. Readers who clicked “Claim My Free Bottle” on the misleading celebrity page were led to a purchase page. However, this one click went through several other pages in a chain. These are called redirects. Hovering over “Claim My Free Bottle” revealed the website petime-wansive.icu/click. Clicking that link went through l1jk2l3j1kl1kj27k21j.com (yes, that is a real domain name), and then a landing page. For Vytalize, the landing page was tryvytalyzecbd.com, which was created in late September 2020. The Northern Sense CBD Oil landing page was zendealsforyounow.com, which was created in December 2020. On the purchase page, interested customers were asked to fill out their information. Once the information was submitted, the page displayed a countdown of five minutes. It said that a 40% off savings would expire within that time frame. The page claimed that stock was low and “sell out risk” was high. Logos for credit card companies were visible. It also displayed logos for Federal Express, UPS, and the USPS. We noticed several logos for security and antivirus software, plus other strange icons. Needless to say, the page did not appear trustworthy. We decided to go back and check part of the celebrity page from step 2 that featured Selleck and others. However, it was gone. Further attempts to reload the celebrity CBD page that featured Selleck resulted in a strange DVD sales page. It featured the 1990 Selleck film, “Quigley Down Under.” The CBD oil pitch page that featured him and the other celebrities had disappeared from view.  So, what happened? Why didn’t the celebrity page load anymore? We looked into the strange disappearance of the celebrity page, and found that it was a matter of cloaking. Cloaking involves serving one kind of page to website visitors and another kind of page to search engines. According to Google, it’s a no-no in the world of website management. In technical terms, the page used an inline frame (IFrame) in the coding of the website. The page with Tom Selleck’s CBD story showed up in one context, but the DVD purchase page showed up in the other. An analogy would be when someone shows one set of books to a tax preparer and another set of books to the bank. In sum, Tom Selleck was not and is not a CBD oil products spokesperson. The entire thing reeked of a scam. We recommend steering clear of any of these kinds of pages.;https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/03/tom-removed-from-blue-bloods.jpg,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/tom-selleck-blue-bloods/,https://www.scribd.com/document/496573682/Tom-Selleck-CBD-Oil-Deceptive-Webpage-for-Snopes-Fact-Check,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cbd-oil-alex-trebek/,https://archive.vn/XKAo2,https://archive.vn/idM9g,https://archive.vn/XKAo2,https://archive.vn/idM9g,https://archive.vn/wrnnb,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/03/quigley-down-under-page.jpg,https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/cloaking;No, Tom Selleck Isn’t a Spokesman for CBD Oil Products;clickbait;;;;;

But what if it were real? That was a question posed by Polish vlogger Agon Hare, who runs the Project Nightfall social media viral video network. “How far can humans go in playing God,” Hare asks at the end of a Feb. 27, 2021, Facebook video. His hypothetical question and video about the prospect of super soldiers populating China’s military forces was spun off from a comment included in a Dec. 3, 2020, opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal by John Ratcliffe, the former Director of National Intelligence under former U.S. President Donald Trump. In the piece, Ratcliffe attempted to make the case that China poses the “greatest threat to America today.” He wrote (emphasis ours): But Ratcliffe didn’t offer any evidence for the statement that the Chinese government is working to genetically alter its soldiers. An analysis of such a possibility published by the BBC on Feb. 8 raised doubts about whether it’s even possible with technology currently available to alter the genes of an adult to enhance that person’s performance. (The BBC also reported that China denied Ratcliffe’s allegations, calling them a “miscellany of lies.”) The BBC article noted that China isn’t the only country that has considered the possibility of using technology to somehow make soldiers stronger. Others include France and the U.S. — in 2014, then-President Barack Obama said the U.S. was working on creating “Iron Man” in a now-defunct project that would have built protective armor suits for soldiers. Both Hare’s video and the BBC’s analysis bring up the case of He Jiankui, a Chinese scientist who made headlines in 2018 for genetically editing twin baby girls to shield them from contracting HIV. China, like most countries have laws banning gene editing to produce enhanced babies, and Jiankui’s work landed him in jail. Even if Jiankiu’s work is indicative of future potentialities, the BBC analysis noted that it’s not so simple as choosing desirable attributes and splicing in genes for them, “Jurassic Park” style: At this time we don’t have evidence to support the claim that the Chinese government is experimenting on its soldiers to genetically enhance them and create “super soldiers.” We sent a question to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence asking whether the Biden administration backs the claim made by its predecessor’s DNI. We will update this story if we receive a response.;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105698/,https://www.marvel.com/characters/captain-america-steve-rogers,https://www.facebook.com/ProjectNightfall/videos/132386892106191,https://archive.is/3Bxzp#selection-2353.0-2370.0,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-55905354,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77pnVFLkUjM,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55243014,https://taskandpurpose.com/military-tech/pentagon-powered-armor-iron-man-suit/#:~:text=The%20military%20called%20this%20particular,project%20was%20abruptly%20shut%20down.,https://www.ft.com/content/98658737-b70d-466a-8920-78b9243ccf07;Is China Genetically Engineering ‘Super Soldiers’?;;;;;;

Speaking to a crowd in Orlando, Florida, the businessman-turned-politician made false claims about the 2020 election, criticized President Joe Biden, and alluded to the possibility of another presidential bid in 2024. Trump also boasted about his administration’s controversial response to the novel coronavirus, largely taking credit for COVID-19 vaccines that had been “produced in record time.” “It would have taken any other president at least five years, and we got it done in nine months, he claimed, adding that he “pushed the FDA like they had never been pushed before.”  Calling vaccine rollout a “calculated risk,” Trump also claimed that his administration put up “billions of dollars to produce vaccines before they knew they were going to work” and that the “Trump Administration deserves full credit.” But never did Trump say that he had received his own dose of the COVID-19 vaccine — a question still unanswered since Trump left the Oval Office, prompting a trend in searches for “did trump get the vaccine?” Click here to view a video of his CPAC address.  Just after the 32-minute mark, Trump told his audience to get the vaccination: “But remember, we took care of a lot of people, including, I guess on December 21st, we took care of Joe Biden. Cause he got his shot. He got his vaccine. He forgot. It shows you how un-painful all that vaccine shot is. So, everybody go get your shot.” And though Trump never outright stated that he had received the COVID-19 vaccination himself, New York Times correspondent Maggie Haberman wrote in a March 1 tweet that an unnamed adviser confirmed that both the president and first lady were vaccinated in the White House in January.  CNN anchor Jim Acosta also tweeted that the Trumps had received their vaccinations, also citing an unknown source:  On Oct. 1, 2020, Trump took to Twitter to announce that he and his wife, Melania Trump, had both tested positive for COVID-19 and were to begin their quarantine process after receiving medical treatment at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. The diagnosis came after the president had spent months downplaying the coronavirus pandemic and reiterating falsehoods about supposed cures, as well as preventative measures such as wearing masks and practicing social distancing. In mid-December, Axios reported that the former president said that he and his White House would be inoculated against the virus “at the appropriate time,” but did not specifically state when. In a now-archived tweet posted on Dec. 13, Trump said: “People working in the White House should receive the vaccine somewhat later in the program, unless specifically necessary. I have asked that this adjustment be made. I am not scheduled to take the vaccine, but look forward to doing so at the appropriate time. Thank you!” As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that more than 96 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccination had been distributed as of March 1, some social media users pointed out that had Trump received his vaccination, he might have shared it publicly as other political figures — including his own vice president — had done. Under guidance issued by the CDC, those who have had COVID-19 infection are still recommended to receive a vaccination.  Snopes contacted the Trump campaign seeking to independently verify that Trump was vaccinated, but did not receive a response at the time of publication. And because neither Haberman nor Acosta named their sources, we rate this claim as “Unproven” as of March 1, 2021.;https://www.snopes.com/ap/2021/02/28/trump-set-to-return-to-the-spotlight-with-cpac-speech/,https://twitter.com/snopes/status/1366148582768844801,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-promise-vaccine-election-day/,https://www.c-span.org/video/?509084-1/president-trump-addresses,https://archive.is/HtNaG,https://archive.is/vJTZE,https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/10/03/when-trump-test-positive-covid/,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2020/10/01/president-trump-and-first-lady-test-positive-for-covid-19/,https://www.npr.org/sections/latest-updates-trump-covid-19-results/2020/10/02/919432383/how-trump-has-downplayed-the-coronavirus-pandemic,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2020/07/28/president-trump-again-pushes-unproven-drug-as-coronavirus-treatment/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cdc-report-majority-wore-masks/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rnc-masks-social-distancing/,https://www.thetrumparchive.com/?searchbox=%22vaccine%22,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2020/12/18/pence-wife-karen-surgeon-general-get-covid-19-vaccines/,https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/clinical-considerations.html;Did Trump Receive COVID-19 Vaccination Before Leaving Office?;COVID-19, COVID-19 Vaccine, donald trump;;;;;

The group’s model air show, a popular entertainment previously presented hundreds of times at halftimes and other events, featured radio-controlled airplanes that performed maneuvers around the stadium, engaged in aerial dogfights, and showcased flying model planes crafted in unusual shapes. On this occasion, however, the exhibition did not go off without a hitch. Partway through the show a model plane crashed into the football field — a harbinger of tragedy to come, especially after the crowd began to grow concerned about how closely some of the aircraft were approaching to fans seated in the stands.  As one spectator present later expressed his unease to the New York Times: Shortly before the end of the 15-minute show, Philip Cushman, a Brooklyn auto collision repairman, lost control of the model aircraft he was guiding, a novel plane shaped like a lawnmower with a red reel and silver handle. The plane circled the stadium a few times, then abruptly nose-dived into the stands about five rows behind the Patriots’ bench on the third-base side of the stadium.  As the lawnmower-shaped craft plummeted into the seats, it struck two spectators, 20-year-old John Bowen of Nashua, New Hampshire, and 25-year-old Kevin Rourke, of Lynn, Massachusetts. Both men suffered serious head injuries from the incident. Kevin Rourke received emergency room treatment for a concussion and was admitted to a hospital for additional observation, while John Bowen, whom one observer at the scene described as looking “like he had been attacked by an ax,” underwent emergency surgery that evening.  Although Rourke recovered satisfactorily and was eventually discharged from the hospital, Bowen died of his injuries four days later. Police and prosecutors began an investigation when it became apparent that Bowen was unlikely to survive his injuries, but Queens district attorney John J. Santucci said authorities “had no reason to believe [the incident] was anything other than an accident,” and the matter was judged to be a civil issue rather than a criminal one.;https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/category/horrors/,https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1979/12/15/111129516.html?pageNumber=29,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/11/archives/2-still-in-hospital-after-shea-mishap.html;The True Story of the Flying Lawnmower Death;freakish fatalities;;;;;

On one side, there’s a singer. And on the other, we see a pianist rush to his seat and hurriedly prepare himself to play as a voice off camera can be heard saying “don’t screw this up.”  The video on the right features a genuine video from CPAC. The video on the left does not.  This rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” was performed by singer Sailor Sabol. While some on social media claimed that this singer is also Ted Cruz’s dog walker (a reference to a misleading claim about the Texas senator “abandoning” his dog when he traveled to Cancun, Mexico, during a severe winter storm), that is not the case. Others claimed that this performance took place just before former U.S. President Donald Trump took the stage. That is also untrue.  According to CPAC’s schedule, this rendition of the national anthem took place on the first day of CPAC 2021. Trump spoke on the final day of the conference. An unaltered version of Sabol’s performance can be seen at the 20 minute mark of the following video: As you can see, this was an a capella version (sans piano accompaniment) of the national anthem.  Sabol’s interpretation of “The Star-Spangled Banner” struck a sour chord with some social media users, who shared video of her rendition with various jokes and criticism. One person, for instance, claimed that this song was in the “key of Q” (a reference to the Qanon conspiracy theory.) As the criticism circulated, some musicians started posting videos of themselves playing along with Sabol. The viral video shared above comes from pianist Larry Goldings.

And it wasn’t long before controversy unfolded.  Eagle-eyed social media users claimed that the stage where Sen. Ted Cruz, Donald Trump Jr., and others made speeches looked eerily like a Nazi or white supremacist symbol.   Some even shared images comparing the stage to old uniforms from Nazi Germany. The image below could have been pulled from a Daily Mail article that claims to show a Nazi SS trooper.  We reviewed videos from CPAC and confirmed that the shape of the stage indeed reflects the images in the above tweets. The first three seconds of the following video show the full stage: But was it truly a Nazi symbol? The shape of the stage, a diamond with two prongs extending on one end, is indeed similar to an early European Othala rune also known as the “Odal rune.” According to the Anti-Defamation League this is a popular Neo-Nazi symbol, but as it is part of an ancient runic alphabet system, it has not solely been used as a hate symbol. It also appears in different forms, sometimes without the two prongs pointing upward. It has, however, been used as the insignia of a number of Nazi divisions during the early 20th century. The rune was used as the logo of the Nazi 7th SS Mountain Division that fought in Croatia and the Balkans in the 1940s. One book “7th SS Mountain Division Prinz Eugen at War 1941-1945: A History of the Division,” with photographs of Nazi soldiers collected by Ian Baxter, features the symbol prominently on its cover. Another historical account by Otto Kumm, a Nazi German commander of the SS during World War II, also features the symbol prominently on its cover. This edition, published in 1995, is available on Amazon.   It was also described as a symbol popular with “skinheads” in a 2006 Edmonton Journal article: “In addition to the swastika, skinheads favor two ancient Nordic runes: the Odal rune which looks like a diamond with tails.” CPAC organizer, Matt Schlapp, responded to the theories surrounding the shape of the stage, calling them “outrageous” and “slanderous”:  We have reached out to CPAC to learn more about their choice of stage and will update this post as more information becomes available.  On March 2, in a statement to Jewish media outlet Forward, the company hired to set up the stage at CPAC took full responsibility for the stage design. Design Foundry said they “had no idea that the design resembled any symbol, nor was there any intention to create something that did.” They added that the American Conservative Union had approved the stage design, which was “intended to provide the best use of space, given the constraints of the ballroom and social distancing requirements.” The terms of the contract CPAC organizers signed with Design Foundry stated, “The designs, renderings, drawings, specifications, materials and other documents used or created as part of the proposal are owned by Design Foundry.”  Ian Walters, communications director for CPAC, told the Forward that the design firm “provided several options for us to choose from and what we ended up with was the most workable of the options they submitted […] ACU and CPAC have no interest in promoting antisemitism from our stage, whether it’s what happens on the stage or the design of the stage itself,” he added. “It’s clear that the company we retained designed a stage that has become an unwelcome distraction.

But that legacy is under fire. On Read Across America Day on March 2, 2021— which is also Dr. Seuss’ birthday — the business that preserves his legacy announced that six of his children’s books would no longer be published due to their offensive and racist content. Some schools also sought to de-emphasize studying his work on that day because of its racial undertones. Dr. Seuss also had a history of creating cartoons featuring racist propaganda, and offensive caricatures of Black people, Asians, and Arabs. Twitter users shared the following cartoons of Black people depicted in an offensive and racist style. We learned that these were indeed created by Dr. Seuss around the time he was creating advertisements and comics as an illustrator.   The top two images portraying Black people in advertisements for Flit, a brand of insect repellant, were created between 1930 and 1940. They are available for download (here and here) in the University of California, San Diego’s digital library collection. The cartoon portraying Black people for sale in a department store was made by Dr. Seuss in 1929 for “Judge” magazine, and was part of a larger comics panel titled, ”Cross-Section of The World’s Most Prosperous Department Store.” The full comic is visible below.  This particular comic was auctioned in 2015 by Los Angeles-based Nate D. Sanders Fine Autographs and Memorabilia, an auction house known for selling Hollywood memorabilia, and more. The auction house did not reveal the names of the seller or the buyer. Their website carried a more detailed description of the image: Given that these are authenticated images from UC San Diego and a prominent auction house, we rate this claim as “True.”;https://www.businessinsider.com/before-dr-seuss-was-famous-he-drew-these-sad-racist-ads-2012-3,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2021/03/02/6-dr-seuss-books-wont-be-published-for-racist-images/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dr-seuss-canceled/,https://www.businessinsider.com/before-dr-seuss-was-famous-he-drew-these-sad-racist-ads-2012-3,https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/object/bb7475442t,https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/object/bb7782613z,https://natedsanders.com/LotDetail.aspx?inventoryid=36654,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-02-at-12.44.56-PM.png,https://natedsanders.com/UserFiles/Image/Orson%20Welles_Citizen%20Kane_Oscar%20brings%20%24861,000.png,https://natedsanders.com/LotDetail.aspx?inventoryid=36654;Did Dr. Seuss Draw Racist Cartoons?;;;;;;

As proof of this, she cited the Coca-Cola logo visible in the top right-hand corner of the screen. The screenshots were also shared on the controversial 4Chan thread /pol/, a frequent online source of political disinformation in recent years. Nigel Farage, former leader of the far-right UK Independence Party, mentioned the story in a YouTube video, saying Coca-Cola had “lost their marbles” by “putting their staff through compulsory training on ‘How to be less white.'” The presentation in question is real, and the “try to be less white” slides were authentic. However, the evidence presented by Borysenko and others does not prove that Coca-Cola included the presentation in its required diversity training for employees, and the company has explicitly denied that claim. The slides contained in the widely-shared online posts in February 2021 came from a presentation entitled “Confronting Racism,” which featured Robin DiAngelo, a writer and consultant whose work on racism has proven controversial and who has been hired to conduct diversity and anti-racism training for many American companies.  The course was created by Big Think, an educational video platform, using footage taken from an earlier interview they conducted with DiAngelo. “Confronting Racism” had been available on LinkedIn Learning, but was removed on Feb. 23, on foot of a request by the producers of the course Big Think, and representatives for DiAngelo. Before it was taken down, it carried the following description: The slides in question appeared during the “What you can do” section of the course:   Those slides appeared as part of a video, which the screenshots shared widely in February 2021 did not fully reflect. In that section of the video, DiAngelo provides the following narration: LinkedIn Learning is a service provided to LinkedIn members with a paid “Premium” subscription. Users do not purchase individual videos, but rather their premium membership gives them access to all the additional content contained in the LinkedIn Learning platform: videos; courses; and “learning paths.” This is an important feature of LinkedIn Learning, in the context of the controversy prompted by Borysenko’s tweets and YouTube videos about Coca-Cola. In a news release published on Feb. 20, Coca-Cola stated that “Confronting Racism” “was not part of the company’s curriculum,” meaning it was not something Coca-Cola obliged its employees to view. Rather, the company said, its training involved use of LinkedIn Learning, and the course was accessible there. So a company employee could log into a Coca-Cola LinkedIn account in order to watch videos that are part of their mandatory diversity training, but then navigate, within LinkedIn Learning, to “Confronting Racism,” which need not be required viewing in order for them to access it. This would allow them to create screenshots that feature slides from the course, alongside a Coca-Cola logo in the top right-hand corner. So, contrary to Borysenko’s claim, the presence of the logo was not proof that “Confronting Racism” was required viewing for company employees, merely that someone at Coca-Cola had viewed it. We asked Coca-Cola to provide details of the company’s “diversity, equity and inclusion training.” A company spokesperson did not provide a comprehensive curriculum, but did provide Snopes several examples of topics included as required viewing. Each of the following items appears to match individual videos available through the LinkedIn Learning platform:  The spokesperson also provided further clarification about Coca-Cola’s use of LinkedIn Learning in company trainings: “On learning channels not owned by The Coca-Cola Company, users had the ability to navigate outside of the intended curriculum which may have given the false impression that certain videos were part of the training.” The controversy appears to have been caused by a fundamental misunderstanding, on the part of Borysenko and others, as to how LinkedIn Learning works, and the fact that Coca-Cola employees could, while taking part in their mandatory training, access hundreds of videos and courses that bore no relation to that training, and were not required. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that, despite Coca-Cola’s clear denials, the existence of a coherent alternative explanation, and despite the complete absence of evidence so far, “Confronting Racism” was in fact listed on the curriculum.";https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/Copy-of-Rating-Overlay-Vertical-19.png,https://archive.is/MjA1q,https://archive.is/CBuVA,https://archive.is/Q2Rmq,https://archive.is/2ORyp,https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/04/08/how-conspiracy-theories-spread-online-its-not-just-algorithms/,https://youtu.be/mglYtZSRa8g?t=220,https://archive.is/zEwtn,https://archive.is/gwwvP,https://archive.is/NjqbD,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/crop_Screenshot-2021-02-22-at-09.43.23.png,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/crop_Screenshot-2021-02-22-at-09.43.00.png,https://archive.is/yXl95;Did Coca-Cola’s Diversity Training Tell Workers ‘Try To Be Less White’?;;;;;;
17;;;;False;Alex Kasprak;2021-03-01;;snopes;https://www.snopes.com/author/alex/;https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/vaccine-lung-damage/;COVID-19 mRNA vaccines will become deadly a few months after administration because the antibodies they create have been shown to cause deadly immune reactions resulting in damage to the lungs.;2021-03-01;snopes;;Sherri Tenpenny, an anti-vaccine activist and doctor of osteopathic medicine who believes Bill Gates is behind various chemtrail, 5G, and vaccine microchip-related, world-domination plans, has been making waves in pseudoscientific circles with a claim that mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 will cause a potentially fatal immune reaction in four to 14 months. Tenpenny, who has described the COVID-19 pandemic as a “scamdemic,” alleged in both interviews and blog posts that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein created by mRNA vaccines will cause delayed but deadly immune reactions. “The problem is that the antibodies that [mRNA COVID-19 vaccines] generate are going to be deadly,” she said in an interview with activist Reinette Senum. “And it’s going to take somewhere between four months and maybe fourteen months before we see the whole ravage of what’s going to happen to people who are vaccinated with this vaccine.” The most effective medical misinformation — and this claim certainly fits the bill — often blends real scientific concepts with baseless assertions in service of a larger distortion. The factual reality Tenpenny is exploiting stems from real concerns researchers had raised about the plausibility of creating a safe vaccine for previous coronavirus-caused diseases such as SARS and MERS. For several complex immunologic reasons discussed below, pre-COVID efforts to create a vaccine for these diseases raised several legitimate vaccine safety concerns. The larger distortion Tenpenny is attempting to push with pre-2020 studies about those efforts is that they were “ignored” by the scientists designing vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), and that their findings hold direct relevance to the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Robert Atmar, a professor of infectious disease at the Baylor College of Medicine who was a co-author on one of two studies Tenpenny relies on extensively to make her faulty argument, told us by email that their “findings do not apply to SARS CoV-2 viruses.” Below, we explain why that is the case. (Snopes sent a detailed list of questions to Tenpenny on Feb. 22, 2021. We received no response. After our deadline for response had passed, an assistant told us Tenpenny was too busy to speak with us, but would be willing to speak at a later date.)  Since the emergence of coronaviruses, there had been several unsuccessful efforts to develop vaccines against the viruses responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Tenpenny relies almost exclusively on two papers discussing those efforts to make her case against the COVID-19 vaccine: a 2019 study on SARS and MERS vaccination efforts, and a 2012 study on immunopathology caused by SARS vaccines in laboratory animals. An immunopathology is an immune system reaction that damages tissue. Both studies described scary results from various animal tests on SARS and MERS candidate vaccines. The basic issue was this: The vaccine candidates appeared to work at first in terms of controlling early infections and creating an immune response. However, when animals who had been vaccinated were exposed to either SARS or MERS following vaccination, their immune systems went into overdrive, causing massive and sometimes fatal damage to the lungs. The reason for these reactions, researchers have come to understand, stem at least in part from the peculiarities of coronaviruses themselves, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (which cause SARS and MERS) and SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19). Interactions between coronavirus spike proteins and the immune system can, research suggests, block the anti-inflammatory half of the immune system and send the immune system into overdrive, leading to immunopathology in the lungs. Severe cases of COVID-19 often present elements of immune-system-mediated damage to lung tissue. Another proposed mechanism for this damage to the lungs is antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). In basic terms, the idea is that some antibodies created to fight these coronaviruses bind only weakly to the virus. As a result, instead of serving to tag or destroy the viral particles, these antibodies actually end up providing further access for a virus to infect cells, and serve to make the infection more severe. Tenpenny refers to this as the “trojan horse” mechanism. There are at least two proposed causes for this phenomenon, but both “occur when non-neutralizing antibodies or antibodies at sub-neutralizing levels bind to viral antigens without blocking or clearing infection.” Not only could these antibodies enhance infection through ADE, Tenpenny alleges, but their presence — in the absence of the immune system’s anti-inflammatory cells — could directly harm lung tissue through inflammation and indirectly by creating an unchecked army of pro-inflammatory immune system cells. For these reasons, Tenpenny implies, a vaccine that creates COVID-19 spike proteins will generate massive immunopathologic damage to the lungs after someone vaccinated to COVID-19 is exposed to the virus. Perhaps the most malicious distortion presented by Tenpenny is that the research on SARS and MERS vaccination was “ignored” by scientists developing COVID-19 vaccines. In fact, the work she highlights very explicitly informed the development of safe COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. When the COVID-19 pandemic was first declared and health officials concluded that a massive vaccination program would be required to return global life to a semblance of pre-pandemic normalcy, immunologists and vaccine scientists very explicitly used the research highlighted by Tenpenny to explain the significant existing challenges inherent to creating a coronavirus vaccine. A September 2020 paper in Nature Microbiology that evaluated “the risks and opportunities for antibody-based protection against SARS-CoV-2,” for example, cited the same work, explaining that “safety concerns for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were initially fueled by mouse studies that showed enhanced immunopathology … in animals vaccinated with SARS-CoV.” Further work on this immunopathology led researchers to conclude that it is caused in cases where the tested vaccine creates what is known as a Th-2-cell-biased immune response. An immune response biased toward the production of Th-2 cells results in many of the conditions described in the scenarios presented by Tenpenny, including blocking or inhibiting anti-inflammatory immune functions and creating a storm of infection-fighting cytokines that actively attack the lung. For this reason, researchers knew any vaccine they designed for COVID-19 should avoid a Th-2 response. A paper in International Archives of Allergy and Immunology, for example, concluded back in June 2020  that “COVID-19 vaccines should … polarize the T-cell response towards type 1 immunity and avoid the stimulation of cytokines which induce T-helper 2 immunity.” In terms of ADE, the same research highlighted by Tenpenny is referenced in myriad papers concerning the development of a safe COVID-19 vaccine as well. Citing the same 2019 study as Tenpenny, the Nature Microbiology review discussed above concluded that evidence for ADE in SARS and MERS is conflicting, but that any potential vaccine-induced ADE could be mitigated by creating a vaccine that generates high numbers of neutralizing — as opposed to non-neutralizing — antibodies. Thanks in part to the work of the researchers highlighted by Tenpenny, then, vaccine developers were aware that any COVID-19 vaccine they developed required two things to be safe from the suite of immunologic responses at issue: the production of high levels of neutralizing antibodies and a Th-1 biased immune response with little to no Th-2 response. A vaccine created that includes these two features, a massive body of evidence ignored by Tenpenny suggests, would overcome the challenges presented in early coronavirus vaccine trials. In her interview with Senum, Tenpenny argued, “If I can learn this sitting in my living room, reading a 19-page paper and several others, so can they” she said referring to doctors who support COVID-19 vaccination. “There’s nothing special about me. I just take the time to do it.” It is unclear how much time Tenpenny actually took to come up with her claims, as she appears to have been uninterested in any paper published since the emergence of the disease for which her claims apply. Tenpenny, in that interview, makes several assertions that belie her ignorance of post-2019 coronavirus vaccine science. She asserts, for example, that COVID-19 vaccines create non-neutralizing antibodies that lead to ADE: This is aggressively false. Both the Moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccines create highly neutralizing antibodies. Had Tenpenny followed the development of the vaccine instead of promoting the pseudo-documentary “Plandemic,” she perhaps might not have missed the studies conducted on the Moderna vaccine indicating that it produces “high levels of binding and neutralizing antibodies.” She might have seen studies conducted on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine indicating that it produces high levels of neutralizing antibodies, as well. This reality is a protection against the ADE Tenpenny falsely alleged to be caused by COVID-19 vaccines. Tenpenny’s argument that COVID-19 vaccines could cause immunopathology stems from her false claim that SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins created by vaccines will block the functions of an anti-inflammatory type 2 macrophages: The inactivation of type two macrophages is one of several outcomes that occur from vaccines that produce a large Th-2 biased response, Baylor’s Atmar told us. As discussed earlier, the defense against this outcome is a vaccine that does not produce a Th-2 response and instead creates a strong Th-1 response. Had Tenpenny researched the actual vaccines she maligns —  instead of sharing articles from Infowars —  she would have learned that both mRNA vaccines produce strong Th-1 biased responses with little to no Th-2 response. In an October 2020 report in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers reported that, “The mRNA-1273 vaccine [i.e Moderna] induced [Th1] biased … responses and low or undetectable Th2 … responses.” As reported in Nature this month, data from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine indicate a “TH1-biased response.” In other words, the biochemical requirements for the scary reactions Tenpenny alleges to be looming in a few months are simply not created by the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. This is by design. Zhiwei Chen, one of the authors on the other study Tenpenny primarily relied on to make her faulty argument, told us by email that “we should not copy and paste the knowledge learnt from SARS” into COVID-19 research. While Tenpenny is certainly guilty of that logical fallacy, the larger distortion she has been creating comes by way of omission. By actively ignoring any vaccine research that has been conducted since the start of the pandemic, she presents outdated theoretical concerns as real while ignoring a scientific reality that refutes them. Because mRNA vaccines induce strongly neutralizing antibodies and a Th-1 biased response, and because the theoretical mechanisms Tenpenny invokes require non-neutralizing antibodies and a Th-2 biased response, her concerns are without merit. The claim that massive lung damage from COVID-19 mRNA vaccination is months away is, therefore, “False.”;https://archive.vn/JNN1q,https://archive.vn/ZpXIJ,https://archive.vn/S9ZEz,https://archive.vn/rsb4u,https://www.bitchute.com/video/hn4WNaqQ9C6h/,https://archive.vn/FWvek,https://www.bitchute.com/video/hn4WNaqQ9C6h/,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-00789-5,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035421,https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/123158,https://archive.vn/FWvek,https://archive.vn/FWvek,https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/123158,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035421,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-00789-5,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(21)00011-4/fulltext,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sji.12969,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-00789-5,https://archive.vn/FWvek#selection-647.0-647.16,https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/509368,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-00789-5,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-00789-5,http://karger.com/Article/FullText/509368,http://karger.com/Article/FullText/509368,https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/509368#f01,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-00789-5,http://karger.com/Article/FullText/509368,https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/123158,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-00789-5,https://www.bitchute.com/video/hn4WNaqQ9C6h/,https://www.bitchute.com/video/hn4WNaqQ9C6h/,https://archive.vn/dOiwb,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2022483,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2032195,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2022483,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03275-y,https://www.bitchute.com/video/hn4WNaqQ9C6h/,http://karger.com/Article/FullText/509368,https://archive.vn/JZOLf,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2024671,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03275-y,https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/123158;Will mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Wreak ‘Havoc on The Lungs’ in 4 to 14 Months?;COVID-19, COVID-19 Vaccine;;;;;

We previously reported it was true that a gold-colored statue of Trump was displayed at the same convention. In the aftermath of the event, pictures of people praying to and bowing before the Trump statue were virally shared on social media. This photograph purported to show evangelical leaders praying over the statue:  However, this picture was doctored. The statue covered up a real person they were praying over: Trump. The majority of the doctored photograph came from an Associated Press photograph. The caption read: “Pastor Paula White-Cain and US President Donald J. Trump remark at the ‘Evangelicals for Trump’ coalition launch Miami at The King Jesus International Ministry on January 3, 2020, in Miami, Florida (Credit: MPI04 / MediaPunch /IPX).” The Jan. 3, 2020, prayer was led by televangelist and White House spiritual adviser Paula White.

The video shows an evangelical pastor telling his following that Pokemon games weren’t just fantasy pastimes for kids, but portals straight to hell. The pastor claimed Pokemon taught children how to “enter into the world of witchcraft” and that it “opens a world of the demonic, of the satanic.”   The video is real, and shows Phil Arms, pastor of Richmond, Texas-based Life Reach Ministries, telling his parishioners that Pokemon games summon demonic forces. It’s a theme Arms was fond of, having authored a book on the subject, entitled “Pokemon & Harry Potter: A Fatal Attraction,” which was published in 2000. The sermon is indicative of the fact that Pokemon, along with myriad other pop culture items, got swept up in a phenomenon known as satanic panic, a moral panic that swept over the United States starting in the 1980s. Although it was most prevalent in the ’80s, aspects of it remained powerful for years afterward. As we previously reported, satanic panic was characterized by widespread but unfounded hysteria that children were being ritually abused and recruited by clandestine satanic forces operating in society. As Vox reports: To state the obvious, there’s no evidence that Pokemon is anything other than a game. We don’t know of any phenomenon in which armies of children are forming satanic cults inspired by Pokemon. Arms is no stranger to controversy. His church was rocked by scandal in 2000 upon revelations that he had stolen from church coffers to feed an addiction to prescription painkillers.;https://www.tiktok.com/@islandarcade/video/6932218109516451077?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgownS%2F9D7XgbUs3dYjPtibQCp1zTf%2FdI8jps51Q6r8nfes3mDdmF%2B2UIDoVzt8tz1OGGgA%3D&language=en&preview_pb=0&sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAA-lkqwAHfStUeZkapDd_k_rjsEJRnnBbKhvq05zi0bVTQSKzFBdqKThheOb99NdEv&share_app_name=musically&share_item_id=6932218109516451077&share_link_id=8dfd3af8-da75-4b42-b23b-d2a7eb65529c&timestamp=1614060187&u_code=dd6mf0739ffej6&user_id=6844018106214646789&utm_campaign=client_share&utm_medium=android&utm_source=copy&source=h5_m&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v2,https://books.google.com/books/about/Pokemon_Harry_Potter.html?id=hRqazeV-yH0C,https://www.vox.com/2016/10/30/13413864/satanic-panic-ritual-abuse-history-explained,https://filmschoolrejects.com/pokemon-satanic-panic/,https://www.snopes.com/news/2017/06/23/satanic-panic/,https://www.vox.com/2016/10/30/13413864/satanic-panic-ritual-abuse-history-explained,https://www.houstonpress.com/news/in-arms-way-6564832;Did a Pastor Say Pokemon Was ‘Satanic Witchcraft’?;TikTok Rumors;;;;;

For weeks after the Jan. 20 inauguration of President Joe Biden, QAnon followers hyped Mar. 4, 2021 as the new date for Trump’s return to the presidency. The theory grew on Telegram and other social media outlets frequented by the far right, and was evidently inspired by the fact that March 4 used to be the inauguration date for presidents until 1933. This information, combined with a misreading of an 1871 law, resulted in the fallacious claim that the U.S. ceased to be a republic, and became a “business” that year. QAnon adherents of this theory claimed that any laws passed after 1871 are invalid, and presidents elected after 1871 are illegitimate. The potential for violence around March 4 and surrounding Biden’s upcoming State of the Union speech has been taken seriously by the government. Around 4,900 National Guard troops will remain in Washington, D.C., through mid-March 2021. Rep. Adam Smith, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a meeting with defense officials in mid-February: “Some of these people have figured out that apparently 75 years ago, the President used to be inaugurated on March 4. Okay, now why that’s relevant, God knows, at any rate, now they are thinking maybe we should gather again and storm the Capitol on March 4 […] that is circulating online.” Smith was also skeptical of whether another similar event would take place on March 4: “Stuff like that circulates all the time, does it mean it’s going to happen, probably not, but if you want to help, tell them not to do that, tell them that the election is over. Joe Biden won. It was a free and fair election, and let’s get to work, that too would help reduce the well I don’t know fear/paranoia that people feel that requires everything that we’re seeing around here.” A late February, Politico report described how security at the U.S. Capitol would remain high amidst reports of extremist attacks during the State of the Union, the date of which has not yet been revealed. Even the Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. jacked up its room rates for March 3 and 4, from more than $500 per night to more than $1,300. No clear reasons for this price jump were available, but various news reports tried to connect the dots. We checked the prices for those dates ourselves:  We called the reservations team at the hotel to inquire about the pricing. A representative wasn’t aware of the price jumps, but said, “It’s not unheard of, it’s probably because they’re just very busy and many people want the same rooms.” They were also not aware of any events or conferences planned at the hotel around that time period. We emailed the Trump International Hotel to learn more, and will update this post if we get more information.  Whether or not violence will actually take place on March 4 remains to be seen, but Trump taking over the presidency again on that date is virtually impossible. Biden was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2021, his government is in power for the next four years, and there is no way the former president can return to take charge before the end of Biden’s term.  Even QAnon adherents have been backing away from this claim. According to a Vice report from Feb. 26, prominent QAnon influencers started calling March 4 a “false flag event” created entirely by the mainstream media to “make the whole movement look dumb.” Reporting around these dates finds little evidence of major events being planned, but violence is possible given the security arrangements. Given that many of QAnon’s influencers are rejecting claims of Trump’s March 4 takeover, and that any overturning of power is highly improbable over the next few days, we rate this claim as “False.”;https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/hold-the-line-qanon-adherents-claim-trump-will-become-president-again-on-march-4/,https://www.loc.gov/item/today-in-history/march-04/,https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7advv/qanon-isnt-so-sure-trump-will-magically-become-president-again-on-march-4?utm_source=reddit.com&utm_source=reddit.com,http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=016/llsl016.db&recNum=0454,https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/hold-the-line-qanon-adherents-claim-trump-will-become-president-again-on-march-4/,https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/17/politics/national-guard-qanon-concerns/index.html,https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/17/politics/national-guard-qanon-concerns/index.html,https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/17/politics/national-guard-qanon-concerns/index.html,https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/17/politics/national-guard-qanon-concerns/index.html,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/25/capitol-police-national-guard-help-early-471579,https://www.washingtonian.com/2021/02/25/trump-hotel-rates-are-over-1300-on-march-4-the-date-in-a-wild-qanon-theory/,https://www.washingtonian.com/2021/02/25/trump-hotel-rates-are-over-1300-on-march-4-the-date-in-a-wild-qanon-theory/,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-9.40.33-AM.png,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/20/us/politics/biden-president.html,https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7advv/qanon-isnt-so-sure-trump-will-magically-become-president-again-on-march-4?utm_source=reddit.com&utm_source=reddit.com,https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7advv/qanon-isnt-so-sure-trump-will-magically-become-president-again-on-march-4?utm_source=reddit.com&utm_source=reddit.com;Will Trump Reclaim the Presidency on March 4?;2020 election;;;;;

One of the boldest statements was that with an environmental group, they worked “to develop a shared vision of an all-electric future and an aspiration to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035.” To achieve this goal, “more than half of GM’s capital spending and product development team will be devoted to electric and electric-autonomous vehicle programs,” according to Reuters.

Barry Rabe, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, told The Washington Post that “This is a very significant pivot … especially for such an iconic American institution,” adding that “This is more than just a quick flip of the dial … It’s a very wrenching transition.” Some sectors will take longer than others, Barry conceded in the announcement: “Heavy-duty vehicles — box trucks, tractor trailers, utility trucks and some heavy pickup trucks — will continue to run on gasoline,” the company told The Washington Post.

The report is based on the fact that the school system announced that it will not be highlighting or focusing on the work of Dr. Seuss for this year’s “Read Across America Day” despite the fact that the holiday was inspired by his work and occurs on the late author’s birthday. National Read Across America day is an initiative by the National Education Association (NEA). Historically, the day has been connected to Dr. Seuss. In the past, NEA partnered with Dr. Seuss Enterprises as part of the holiday. That is no longer the case, however. NEA’s website explains that the “Read Across America brand is now one that is independent of any one particular book, publisher, or character.” Dr. Seuss’ work has been reevaluated in the context of race in recent years. “As we become more culturally responsive and racially conscious, all building leaders should know that in recent years there has been research revealing radical undertones in the books written and the illustrations drawn by Dr. Seuss,” an announcement by the school district reportedly said. A study published in 2019, as described by Learning for Justice, a nonprofit linked to the Read Across America campaign, concluded that: In response to the viral stories, the Loudoun County pushed back, calling claims that they had “canceled” Dr. Seuss incorrect: Because Loudoun County — like the NEA itself — has made the decision to not focus solely on Dr. Seuss for National Read Across America Day, but because the county has also not restricted the reading or availability of Dr. Seuss’ books in any way, we rank the claim “Mostly False.”;https://www.dailywire.com/news/oh-the-places-the-woke-will-go-dr-seuss-canceled-for-racial-undertones,https://www.nea.org/resource-library/read-across-america-frequently-asked-questions,https://sophia.stkate.edu/rdyl/vol1/iss2/4/,https://www.dailywire.com/news/oh-the-places-the-woke-will-go-dr-seuss-canceled-for-racial-undertones,https://www.learningforjustice.org/magazine/its-time-to-talk-about-dr-seuss,https://www.lcps.org/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID=1&ModuleInstanceID=274904&ViewID=6446EE88-D30C-497E-9316-3F8874B3E108&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=401332&PageID=1;Did a Virginia Public School System ‘Cancel’ Dr. Seuss?;Dr. Seuss, Editor's Picks;;;;;

If a picture has been photoshopped, it’s unlikely you’ll find multiple pictures of the object from different angles. Surprisingly, we found an additional photograph of this SnAK-47, which indicates that this is a physical object, not a digitally created one:  While these pictures appear to document a physical object, this “snake” is not real. For one, it seems unlikely that a snake’s body would wrap so tightly around the angular shape of this gun. If a snake did eat an AK-47, its body would stretch from one protuberance to another, creating a more rounded shape.  So if this picture isn’t photoshopped, and if this physical object isn’t a real snake, what exactly does it show?  It shows art work created by Vasily Slonov, a Russian political artist, called “Python-AK.” According to Artsy.net, this art is made of rubber and was created in 2019.

The group’s model air show, a popular entertainment previously presented hundreds of times at halftimes and other events, featured radio-controlled airplanes that performed maneuvers around the stadium, engaged in aerial dogfights, and showcased flying model planes crafted in unusual shapes. On this occasion, however, the exhibition did not go off without a hitch. Partway through the show a model plane crashed into the football field — a harbinger of tragedy to come, especially after the crowd began to grow concerned about how closely some of the aircraft were approaching to fans seated in the stands.  As one spectator present later expressed his unease to the New York Times: Shortly before the end of the 15-minute show, Philip Cushman, a Brooklyn auto collision repairman, lost control of the model aircraft he was guiding, a novel plane shaped like a lawnmower with a red reel and silver handle. The plane circled the stadium a few times, then abruptly nose-dived into the stands about five rows behind the Patriots’ bench on the third-base side of the stadium.  As the lawnmower-shaped craft plummeted into the seats, it struck two spectators, 20-year-old John Bowen of Nashua, New Hampshire, and 25-year-old Kevin Rourke, of Lynn, Massachusetts. Both men suffered serious head injuries from the incident. Kevin Rourke received emergency room treatment for a concussion and was admitted to a hospital for additional observation, while John Bowen, whom one observer at the scene described as looking “like he had been attacked by an ax,” underwent emergency surgery that evening.  Although Rourke recovered satisfactorily and was eventually discharged from the hospital, Bowen died of his injuries four days later. Police and prosecutors began an investigation when it became apparent that Bowen was unlikely to survive his injuries, but Queens district attorney John J. Santucci said authorities “had no reason to believe [the incident] was anything other than an accident,” and the matter was judged to be a civil issue rather than a criminal one.;https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/category/horrors/,https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1979/12/15/111129516.html?pageNumber=29,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/11/archives/2-still-in-hospital-after-shea-mishap.html;The True Story of the Flying Lawnmower Death;freakish fatalities;;;;;

31;;;;What's Undetermined;Nur Ibrahim;2021-02-27;;snopes;https://www.snopes.com/author/nuribrahim/;https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cpac-stage-nazi-symbol/;The stage at CPAC 2021 was intentionally designed to look like an early European rune, which has also been used as a Nazi symbol.;2021-02-27;snopes;;The Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) was underway in late February 2021 in Orlando, Florida, complete with a golden statue of former U.S. President Donald Trump. And it wasn’t long before controversy unfolded.  Eagle-eyed social media users claimed that the stage where Sen. Ted Cruz, Donald Trump Jr., and others made speeches looked eerily like a Nazi or white supremacist symbol.   Some even shared images comparing the stage to old uniforms from Nazi Germany. The image below could have been pulled from a Daily Mail article that claims to show a Nazi SS trooper.  We reviewed videos from CPAC and confirmed that the shape of the stage indeed reflects the images in the above tweets. The first three seconds of the following video show the full stage: But was it truly a Nazi symbol? The shape of the stage, a diamond with two prongs extending on one end, is indeed similar to an early European Othala rune also known as the “Odal rune.” According to the Anti-Defamation League this is a popular Neo-Nazi symbol, but as it is part of an ancient runic alphabet system, it has not solely been used as a hate symbol. It also appears in different forms, sometimes without the two prongs pointing upward. It has, however, been used as the insignia of a number of Nazi divisions during the early 20th century. The rune was used as the logo of the Nazi 7th SS Mountain Division that fought in Croatia and the Balkans in the 1940s. One book “7th SS Mountain Division Prinz Eugen at War 1941-1945: A History of the Division,” with photographs of Nazi soldiers collected by Ian Baxter, features the symbol prominently on its cover. Another historical account by Otto Kumm, a Nazi German commander of the SS during World War II, also features the symbol prominently on its cover. This edition, published in 1995, is available on Amazon.   It was also described as a symbol popular with “skinheads” in a 2006 Edmonton Journal article: “In addition to the swastika, skinheads favor two ancient Nordic runes: the Odal rune which looks like a diamond with tails.” CPAC organizer, Matt Schlapp, responded to the theories surrounding the shape of the stage, calling them “outrageous” and “slanderous”:  We have reached out to CPAC to learn more about their choice of stage and will update this post as more information becomes available.  On March 2, in a statement to Jewish media outlet Forward, the company hired to set up the stage at CPAC took full responsibility for the stage design. Design Foundry said they “had no idea that the design resembled any symbol, nor was there any intention to create something that did.” They added that the American Conservative Union had approved the stage design, which was “intended to provide the best use of space, given the constraints of the ballroom and social distancing requirements.” The terms of the contract CPAC organizers signed with Design Foundry stated, “The designs, renderings, drawings, specifications, materials and other documents used or created as part of the proposal are owned by Design Foundry.”  Ian Walters, communications director for CPAC, told the Forward that the design firm “provided several options for us to choose from and what we ended up with was the most workable of the options they submitted […] ACU and CPAC have no interest in promoting antisemitism from our stage, whether it’s what happens on the stage or the design of the stage itself,” he added. “It’s clear that the company we retained designed a stage that has become an unwelcome distraction. As a result, we will not be using that company’s services going forward at future events.” The shape of the Nazi symbol is eerily similar to the shape of the stage at CPAC. However, we are presently unable to confirm whether this was a deliberate choice made by the event organizers. At the moment, we rate this claim as “Unproven.”;https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/golden-trump-statue-cpac/,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2603624/Topman-forced-apologise-selling-jacket-SS-symbol-chest.html,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/Copy-of-Rating-Overlay-Vertical-2.jpg,https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/othala-rune,https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/ucnGwQEACAAJ?hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjYvJzhtYrvAhXtguAKHWtMDeAQ7_IDMBR6BAgKEAI,https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/ucnGwQEACAAJ?hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjYvJzhtYrvAhXtguAKHWtMDeAQ7_IDMBR6BAgKEAI,https://www.amazon.com/History-Mountain-Division-Prinz-Eugen/dp/0921991290,https://www.amazon.com/History-Mountain-Division-Prinz-Eugen/dp/0921991290,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/417vnKduXKL.jpg,https://www.snopes.com/uploads/2021/02/clipping_72193773.pdf,https://forward.com/fast-forward/465136/design-firm-takes-responsibility-for-cpac-stage-controversy/,https://web.archive.org/web/20210303140906/https://forward.com/fast-forward/465136/design-firm-takes-responsibility-for-cpac-stage-controversy/;Was the CPAC Stage Intentionally Shaped Like a Nazi Symbol?;nazi symbols;;;;;

But that legacy is under fire. On Read Across America Day on March 2, 2021— which is also Dr. Seuss’ birthday — the business that preserves his legacy announced that six of his children’s books would no longer be published due to their offensive and racist content. Some schools also sought to de-emphasize studying his work on that day because of its racial undertones. Dr. Seuss also had a history of creating cartoons featuring racist propaganda, and offensive caricatures of Black people, Asians, and Arabs. Twitter users shared the following cartoons of Black people depicted in an offensive and racist style. We learned that these were indeed created by Dr. Seuss around the time he was creating advertisements and comics as an illustrator.   The top two images portraying Black people in advertisements for Flit, a brand of insect repellant, were created between 1930 and 1940. They are available for download (here and here) in the University of California, San Diego’s digital library collection. The cartoon portraying Black people for sale in a department store was made by Dr. Seuss in 1929 for “Judge” magazine, and was part of a larger comics panel titled, ”Cross-Section of The World’s Most Prosperous Department Store.” The full comic is visible below.  This particular comic was auctioned in 2015 by Los Angeles-based Nate D. Sanders Fine Autographs and Memorabilia, an auction house known for selling Hollywood memorabilia, and more. The auction house did not reveal the names of the seller or the buyer. Their website carried a more detailed description of the image: Given that these are authenticated images from UC San Diego and a prominent auction house, we rate this claim as “True.”;https://www.businessinsider.com/before-dr-seuss-was-famous-he-drew-these-sad-racist-ads-2012-3,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2021/03/02/6-dr-seuss-books-wont-be-published-for-racist-images/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dr-seuss-canceled/,https://www.businessinsider.com/before-dr-seuss-was-famous-he-drew-these-sad-racist-ads-2012-3,https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/object/bb7475442t,https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/object/bb7782613z,https://natedsanders.com/LotDetail.aspx?inventoryid=36654,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-02-at-12.44.56-PM.png,https://natedsanders.com/UserFiles/Image/Orson%20Welles_Citizen%20Kane_Oscar%20brings%20%24861,000.png,https://natedsanders.com/LotDetail.aspx?inventoryid=36654;Did Dr. Seuss Draw Racist Cartoons?;;;;;;
33;;;;What's Undetermined;Dan MacGuill;2021-02-22;;snopes;https://www.snopes.com/author/danmacguill/;https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/coca-cola-training-less-white/;"Coca-Cola's diversity, equity, and inclusion training contained slides which read ""Try to be less white.""";2021-02-22;snopes;;"In February 2021, several readers asked Snopes to examine the authenticity and accuracy of online posts which claimed that Coca-Cola had given its employees diversity training that included slides encouraging them to “try to be less white.” On Feb. 19, the Twitter account @LeftyMoment posted a widely shared tweet which contained the caption “This was in Coca-Cola’s diversity training” along with an image that appeared to be composed of two screenshots: one showing a presentation slide with the words “Try to be less white”; and the other with a list of “white” traits, explaining that “to be less white” means being “less oppressive,” “less arrogant,” “less certain” and so on:  Those and other similar images appeared to have been leaked by a Coca-Cola employee to Karlyn Borysenko, a prominent online opponent of critical race theory and many aspects of corporate diversity training, who describes herself on LinkedIn as an organizational pyschologist and “executive/performance coach.” Borysenko shared the screenshots on Feb. 19, consistently characterizing them as having been part of required training for Coca-Cola employees. As proof of this, she cited the Coca-Cola logo visible in the top right-hand corner of the screen. The screenshots were also shared on the controversial 4Chan thread /pol/, a frequent online source of political disinformation in recent years. Nigel Farage, former leader of the far-right UK Independence Party, mentioned the story in a YouTube video, saying Coca-Cola had “lost their marbles” by “putting their staff through compulsory training on ‘How to be less white.'” The presentation in question is real, and the “try to be less white” slides were authentic. However, the evidence presented by Borysenko and others does not prove that Coca-Cola included the presentation in its required diversity training for employees, and the company has explicitly denied that claim. The slides contained in the widely-shared online posts in February 2021 came from a presentation entitled “Confronting Racism,” which featured Robin DiAngelo, a writer and consultant whose work on racism has proven controversial and who has been hired to conduct diversity and anti-racism training for many American companies.  The course was created by Big Think, an educational video platform, using footage taken from an earlier interview they conducted with DiAngelo. “Confronting Racism” had been available on LinkedIn Learning, but was removed on Feb. 23, on foot of a request by the producers of the course Big Think, and representatives for DiAngelo. Before it was taken down, it carried the following description: The slides in question appeared during the “What you can do” section of the course:   Those slides appeared as part of a video, which the screenshots shared widely in February 2021 did not fully reflect. In that section of the video, DiAngelo provides the following narration: LinkedIn Learning is a service provided to LinkedIn members with a paid “Premium” subscription. Users do not purchase individual videos, but rather their premium membership gives them access to all the additional content contained in the LinkedIn Learning platform: videos; courses; and “learning paths.” This is an important feature of LinkedIn Learning, in the context of the controversy prompted by Borysenko’s tweets and YouTube videos about Coca-Cola. In a news release published on Feb. 20, Coca-Cola stated that “Confronting Racism” “was not part of the company’s curriculum,” meaning it was not something Coca-Cola obliged its employees to view. Rather, the company said, its training involved use of LinkedIn Learning, and the course was accessible there. So a company employee could log into a Coca-Cola LinkedIn account in order to watch videos that are part of their mandatory diversity training, but then navigate, within LinkedIn Learning, to “Confronting Racism,” which need not be required viewing in order for them to access it. This would allow them to create screenshots that feature slides from the course, alongside a Coca-Cola logo in the top right-hand corner. So, contrary to Borysenko’s claim, the presence of the logo was not proof that “Confronting Racism” was required viewing for company employees, merely that someone at Coca-Cola had viewed it. We asked Coca-Cola to provide details of the company’s “diversity, equity and inclusion training.” A company spokesperson did not provide a comprehensive curriculum, but did provide Snopes several examples of topics included as required viewing. Each of the following items appears to match individual videos available through the LinkedIn Learning platform:  The spokesperson also provided further clarification about Coca-Cola’s use of LinkedIn Learning in company trainings: “On learning channels not owned by The Coca-Cola Company, users had the ability to navigate outside of the intended curriculum which may have given the false impression that certain videos were part of the training.” The controversy appears to have been caused by a fundamental misunderstanding, on the part of Borysenko and others, as to how LinkedIn Learning works, and the fact that Coca-Cola employees could, while taking part in their mandatory training, access hundreds of videos and courses that bore no relation to that training, and were not required. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that, despite Coca-Cola’s clear denials, the existence of a coherent alternative explanation, and despite the complete absence of evidence so far, “Confronting Racism” was in fact listed on the curriculum.";https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/Copy-of-Rating-Overlay-Vertical-19.png,https://archive.is/MjA1q,https://archive.is/CBuVA,https://archive.is/Q2Rmq,https://archive.is/2ORyp,https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/04/08/how-conspiracy-theories-spread-online-its-not-just-algorithms/,https://youtu.be/mglYtZSRa8g?t=220,https://archive.is/zEwtn,https://archive.is/gwwvP,https://archive.is/NjqbD,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/crop_Screenshot-2021-02-22-at-09.43.23.png,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/crop_Screenshot-2021-02-22-at-09.43.00.png,https://archive.is/yXl95;Did Coca-Cola’s Diversity Training Tell Workers ‘Try To Be Less White’?;;;;;;
