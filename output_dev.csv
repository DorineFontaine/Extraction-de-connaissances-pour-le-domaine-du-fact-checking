0;;;;False;Abbas Panjwani;2021-04-23;;fullfact;;https://fullfact.org/online/yeadon-covid-vaccine/;Masks don’t work.;2021-04-23;fullfact;;Ex-Pfizer scientist turned lockdown sceptic Mike Yeadon appears in a video liked thousands of times on social media telling mistruths about the pandemic. He first claims: “You don’t need masks, they don’t work.” Masks do work. Masks have been shown in various studies to reduce the transmission of viral particles. It may be the case that respirators work better than surgical masks, but surgical masks are still beneficial. There is a reason why they are used and have been used for decades in healthcare settings.  Mr Yeadon then says: “Forget lockdowns, they never slow transmission which took place mostly in institutions like hospitals and care homes.” The effect of lockdowns on reducing transmission has been covered by various scientific papers. Theoretically, you would expect lockdowns, which limit the interaction of humans, to slow the spread of a disease which is spread by person-to-person contact.  Circumstantial evidence also points to this conclusion. In England, there have been three lockdowns, in March 2020, in November 2020 and in January 2021. In each case, following the introduction of lockdown measures, cases and deaths which had been rising, then fell.   It is worth noting that Mr Yeadon’s previous explanation for why cases and deaths fell in the spring of 2021 was that herd immunity had been reached which was evidently not true as tens of thousands of excess deaths were recorded over winter.  As for the claim that transmission mainly happened in institutions, there isn’t enough evidence to say this. Some studies point to contact within households being responsible for the majority of infections. We’ve written before on how it’s hard to know whether cases of Covid-19 in hospitals are actually due to hospital transmission. Mr Yeadon then says: “You don’t need to be vaccinated by inadequately tested and somewhat dangerous gene-based spike protein-inducing proteins [sic].” Three Covid-19 vaccines have been approved by the UK regulator for use at the time of writing: the Moderna vaccine, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Multiple stages of trials have proved that these three vaccines are safe and effective. Although a possible link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and an incredibly rare kind of blood clot is still being investigated, the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risks for most people.  The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines both use mRNA “gene” technology which, once inside the body, provides the instructions on how to produce spike proteins like those found on the surface of the Covid-19 virus, prompting the body to generate antibodies. This is not dangerous.;https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/health-coronavirus-vaccines-skeptic/,https://www.facebook.com/Breesmedia/videos/481776226294909,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext#%20,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7309199/#:~:text=The%20surgical%20mask%20was%20used,renounced%20for%20a%20long%20time.,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-lockdowns-idUSKBN23F1G3,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32153-X/fulltext,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/,https://lockdownsceptics.org/the-pcr-false-positive-pseudo-epidemic/,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/978128/Weekly_report_mortality__W15.pdf,https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3181,https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/209673/covid-19-spread-different-social-settings-imperial/,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-transmission-hospitals/,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/moderna-vaccine-becomes-third-covid-19-vaccine-approved-by-uk-regulator,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/second-covid-19-vaccine-authorised-by-medicines-regulator,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-medicines-regulator-gives-approval-for-first-uk-covid-19-vaccine,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/vaccine-development,https://fullfact.org/health/astra-zeneca-clotting/,https://fullfact.org/online/moderna-vaccine-not-change-dna/,https://fullfact.org/online/stanford-face-masks-paper/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/godfrey-bloom-video-makes-false-claims-about-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/street-fight-was-not-filmed-when-lockdown-eased-england/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/third-wave-model-vaccine/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/quarter-covid-death-certificate/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content;Mike Yeadon wrong again on lockdowns and face masks;;;;;;
1;;;;undefined;Grace Rahman;2021-04-23;;fullfact;;https://fullfact.org/health/32-vaccinated-hospital/;Only 32 vaccinated people have been hospitalised with Covid.;2021-04-23;fullfact;;An article in the Telegraph has claimed that only 32 vaccinated people were hospitalised with Covid-19 in recent months. It also said that “of 74,405 Covid-19 cases admitted to hospitals between September and March, just 32 had received a vaccine at least three weeks before.” This paints a misleading picture of what exactly has happened with vaccinated people getting hospitalised for Covid-19. Researchers looked at a number of hospital admissions in the UK during the second wave, 74,405 to be exact, between September 2020 and March 2021. From 8 December 2020, the date the first people were vaccinated in the UK outside of trials, 42,788 were admitted. Of those, 1,802 had been vaccinated.  The vaccine doesn’t offer protection from Covid-19 immediately after having it. Regardless of the particular vaccine you get, immunity from just one dose is thought to peak between three and four weeks after the injection. The researchers worked out how many of the 1,802 vaccinated hospitalised people had received the vaccine three or more weeks before. According to one of the researchers involved, Professor Calum Semple, who spoke to the Today programme, that number was 32. But it’s not correct to look at that 32 as a proportion of the total 74,405 patients in the study (as the Telegraph did) to show how effective the vaccine seems to be at stopping hospitalisations for Covid. That’s because the 74,405 figure includes people who were hospitalised in the months before the vaccine roll-out even began, as well as those who had been vaccinated, but caught Covid-19 before the vaccine had a chance to build up immunity (three weeks after they got it). Dividing 32 by 74,000 to get “one case per 2,300 patients”, as the Telegraph has done, is misleading. We could calculate a different figure: the percentage of theoretically fully immunised people who did end up in hospital with Covid. To do that we’d divide 32 by 1,802, which is 1.8%. That is still a pretty good sign that the vaccine is working. The Telegraph also claimed that this showed the vaccines “offered protection far above the levels which had been anticipated”. It’s true that these findings show that the vaccine works and works well, but not beyond the realms of possibility considering other sources of data which used different methodologies. The research described by the Telegraph wasn’t published in a journal and peer-reviewed as normal studies are—it is part of rapidly produced evidence by academics from multiple universities presented to SAGE, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. It was presented to SAGE on 11 March.;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/20/exclusive-just-32-people-hospital-covid-vaccination/?utm_content=telegraph&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=Echobox&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1618951148,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/973183/S1143_Hospitalised_vaccinated_patients_during_the_second_wave__2_.pdf,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/health-55153325,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/?utm_campaign=coronavirus_grants&utm_medium=paid_searchl&utm_source=google&utm_content=keyword&gclid=CjwKCAjwmv-DBhAMEiwA7xYrdyXKsALttU1WrzhMgsKuQ8-vpzb8E0czKnT9lrhSQgTnoZsGPcq6kBoCe-gQAvD_BwE,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000v8w6,https://publichealthscotland.scot/news/2021/february/vaccine-linked-to-reduction-in-risk-of-covid-19-admissions-to-hospitals/,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/971017/SP_PH__VE_report_20210317_CC_JLB.pdf#page=8,https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2021/02/23/covid-19-analysing-first-vaccine-effectiveness-in-the-uk/,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/isaric4c-hospitalised-vaccinated-patients-during-the-second-wave-11-march-2021,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-vaccine-shedding-side-effects-unvaccinated/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-19-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-19-variant/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/ivermectin-covid-treatment/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/facebook-post-makes-misleading-claims-about-covid-19-passports-and-death-rate/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content;There’s more to the claim only 32 vaccinated people were hospitalised with Covid-19;;;;;;
2;;;;undefined;Sarah Turnnidge;2021-04-15;;fullfact;;https://fullfact.org/online/quarter-covid-death-certificate/;A quarter of Covid-19 deaths were not caused by the virus.;2021-04-15;fullfact;;Several major media organisations reported this week that a quarter of Covid-19 deaths in the week ending 2 April 2021 were not caused by the virus.  This is broadly correct. Data shows 23% of deaths involving Covid-19 that week did not have Covid-19 as the underlying cause of death, but it was mentioned as one of a number of other factors on the death certificate.  However, these news reports have since been widely shared on social media out of context, with many people wrongly claiming that a quarter of all deaths categorised as Covid-19 deaths were not caused by the virus.  This is false. Reporting on this topic is based on the most recent Office for National Statistics (ONS) data, which covers the week ending 2 April 2021.  This figure has been shared widely on social media without any caveats, which means many people are interpreting it as applying to the pandemic as a whole. Others have presented it as new information that they say proves previous claims made during the pandemic that the death figures have been inflated. However, this information has been published regularly as part of the weekly death figures for months.  The ONS figures show us that since the start of 2021, 88% of deaths involving Covid-19 were deaths where Covid-19 was listed as the underlying (that is, the primary) cause of death.  The Telegraph led with the story on its front page on Wednesday, with the headline “Quarter of virus deaths not caused by Covid”. Online this appeared as “Quarter of Covid deaths not caused by virus, new figures show”.  “Nearly a quarter of registered Covid deaths are NOT caused by the virus, new statistics show amid calls to speed up route out of lockdown”, read the Mail Online’s headline, while The Sun said: “NOT COVID: Quarter of virus deaths were not caused by Covid as official figures show deadly bug was not primary cause”.  The Express headlined its article: “MP calls for lockdown lift after data shows quarter of Covid deaths not 'from' virus”. None of the papers mentioned explicitly state in the article text that these figures only relate to one week of data, though this is mentioned in the caption of a graph in The Sun and a graph in the Telegraph. A picture caption in the Mail Online only states that there were 400 deaths involving Covid-19 in the week ending 2 April. In this week there were 400 deaths registered involving Covid-19 in England and Wales, meaning Covid-19 was mentioned on the person’s death certificate. Of those, 308 (77%)  had Covid-19 recorded as the underlying cause of death. That was up slightly from 74% the week before, and 77% the week before that.  In the week ending 29 January the deadliest week of the pandemic’s second wave according to ONS statistics, this figure was 90%.  Debates on the definition of Covid-19 deaths have persisted throughout the pandemic. The ONS publishes information on the number of deaths registered in England and Wales every week.  Deaths involving Covid-19 are categorised in two main ways by the ONS. The first is deaths where Covid-19 is named specifically as the underlying cause, which in this context means: “the disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death”. This is decided by a health professional or coroner, and we can say Covid-19 directly caused these deaths.  The second is where Covid-19 is mentioned on the death certificate, but is not pinpointed as the underlying cause of death. As Full Fact has previously reported, death certificates give doctors space to record several different diseases or conditions that contributed to someone’s death, but only one can be recorded as the underlying cause. In cases where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, but another disease such as cancer was named as the underlying cause of death, it would be misleading to say that person died of Covid-19. These are the deaths that are deemed to be ‘with’ Covid-19, not from it.;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/13/quarter-covid-deaths-not-caused-virus/,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14642180/quarter-covid-deaths-not-caused-by-virus/,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9467793/Covid-lockdown-UK-Nearly-quarter-people-dying-Covid-NOT-killed-virus.html,https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1422786/lockdown-news-coronavirus-deaths-quarter-ons-tory-mp-boris-johnson-cases-ont?fbclid=IwAR3xVo_POn8Bvc5NrF-DPJBVqJ_BunLazNlE79jz4V7FSjpW-0WH4uWPSt8,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending2april2021,https://www.facebook.com/zerotolerancemedia2021/photos/a.164996445271930/226940849077489/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/UnityNewsNetwork/photos/a.438778333211289/1155186218237160/?type=3&theater,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/monthlymortalityanalysisenglandandwales/september2020,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/weeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales,https://www.tomorrowspapers.co.uk/daily-telegraph-front-page-2021-04-14/,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/13/quarter-covid-deaths-not-caused-virus/,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9467793/Covid-lockdown-UK-Nearly-quarter-people-dying-Covid-NOT-killed-virus.html,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14642180/quarter-covid-deaths-not-caused-by-virus/,https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1422786/lockdown-news-coronavirus-deaths-quarter-ons-tory-mp-boris-johnson-cases-ont,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending2april2021,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending2april2021#main-points,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending2april2021#deaths-registered-by-week,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending29january2021,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/previousReleases,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/877302/guidance-for-doctors-completing-medical-certificates-of-cause-of-death-covid-19.pdf#page=5,https://fullfact.org/health/liam-fox-death-figures/,https://fullfact.org/health/flu-covid-deaths/,https://fullfact.org/health/flu-covid-deaths/,https://fullfact.org/online/london-lockdown-protest/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/astrazeneca-vaccine-sids/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/yeadon-covid-vaccine/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/stanford-face-masks-paper/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/godfrey-bloom-video-makes-false-claims-about-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content;Claims that a quarter of all Covid-19 deaths weren’t caused by the virus misinterpret the data;;;;;;
3;;;;undefined;Sarah Turnnidge;2021-04-14;;fullfact;;https://fullfact.org/online/covid-vaccine-animal-testing/;All animals used in Covid-19 vaccine trials died months later from immune disorders, sepsis and/or cardiac failure.;2021-04-14;fullfact;;A viral Facebook post claims that all animals involved in Covid-19 vaccine studies died months later from immune disorders, sepsis and/or cardiac failure.  This is false.  The post appears to be a screenshot of an online article which makes a number of incorrect claims. The study this particular claim is based on was about severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and published in 2012. It did not focus on Covid-19 vaccines, or even use the same technology that underpins the vaccines currently being used against Covid-19. And even in this study, the animals were euthanized—they did not die in the ways described in the post.  As we have written before, the Covid-19 vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca) have been tested on animals.  Chris Magee, head of policy and media at UK non-profit Understanding Animal Research (UAR), told Full Fact that in the case of Covid-19 vaccines, data already existed to indicate the vaccines were safe, which enabled researchers to run animal trials alongside the early stages of human trials. Had the animals died during this process, he said, the human trials would have been immediately halted. The fact that they were not indicates the animals did not die unexpectedly. He also said animals used in drug trials are usually euthanized, so scientists can examine their internal organs for signs of pathology.  The lead author of the 2012 study has previously confirmed to Reuters that the animals used in his research, mice, did not die as a result of the vaccines they were given. He also highlighted the fact that vaccines they tested in the 2012 study did not use mRNA technology like some of the Covid-19 vaccines, such as the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, and were in fact “very different vaccine platforms”. There is no evidence to substantiate claims that the animals died “months later” from other conditions as described in the post. The screenshot of the article also claims “coronavirus vaccine caused liver inflammation in test animals”. This statement (in the original article) links to a 2004 study which, in response to the 2003 SARs outbreak, tested a vaccine on ferrets and found it was associated with enhanced hepatitis in the animals. Again, this vaccine was not created to tackle the SARS-CoV-2 virus and is not based on the mRNA technology that underpins vaccines such as Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=140263564695691&set=a.104954514893263&type=3&theater,https://www.primarydoctor.org/covidvaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3436093/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3335060/,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,https://www.understandinganimalresearch.org.uk/about-us/,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-mice-idUSKBN2A22UW,https://www.primarydoctor.org/covidvaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC525089/,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Moderna.html,https://fullfact.org/online/london-lockdown-protest/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/astrazeneca-vaccine-sids/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/yeadon-covid-vaccine/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/stanford-face-masks-paper/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/godfrey-bloom-video-makes-false-claims-about-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content;Covid-19 vaccine did not kill every animal it was tested on;;;;;;
