The footage, confirmed by several news reports, is real. The photographer, David Waterfield, was walking at the Samphire Hoe nature reserve and later described the impressive moment to the British outlet ITV: According to Voice of America, the section of cliff fell after weeks of heavy rain and winds that potentially weakened the cliffs. While it may take luck to witness such an event on human time scales, on geologic time scales such occurrences are to be expected. Steep sea cliffs like the White Cliffs of Dover are constantly subject to erosion through myriad processes. Scientists estimate that the erosion of the cliffs has sped up in the past 150 years, from a rate of about 2 to 6 centimeters per year to a current range of 22 to 32 centimeters per year. The authors of the 2016 study that came up with that rate suggested the increased erosion “is the result of thinning of cliff-front beaches, exacerbated by regional storminess and anthropogenic modification of the coast.” This erosion does not need to occur in small, centimeter chunks. Sometimes these averages are driven by a large loss of material shed in dramatic and rare (on human time scales) events like the one captured by Waterfeield. Because the footage is reported to be authentic and is scientifically consistent with the geomorphological processes at places like the White Cliffs, we rate this claim “True.”","https://twitter.com/adamclarkitv/status/1357002525795352576,https://www.voanews.com/europe/section-britains-white-cliffs-dover-falls-sea,https://www.itv.com/news/meridian/2021-02-03/eyewitness-describes-large-bang-as-section-of-dover-white-cliffs-collapses,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9220421/Incredible-footage-shows-White-Cliffs-Dover-collapsing-English-Channel.html,https://www.itv.com/news/meridian/2021-02-03/eyewitness-describes-large-bang-as-section-of-dover-white-cliffs-collapses,https://www.voanews.com/europe/section-britains-white-cliffs-dover-falls-sea,https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/11/02/1613044113,https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/11/02/1613044113",Does Video Show a Chunk of the White Cliffs of Dover Falling Into the Sea?,,,,,,

It was significantly revamped beginning in 1997 by the current Duchess of Northumberland, Jane Percy. According to head gardener Trever Jones, the Duchess came up with the idea for the poison garden, which opened in 2005. “It was the brainchild of the Duchess,” Jones explained in a video produced by Great Big Story. “So rather than having a herb garden, she decided to create more interest and have a poison garden.” Explaining the decision on an earlier version of the garden’s website, she wrote: “Every plant here in the poison garden is poisonous and has the ability to kill you,” Jones explained, before listing off several plants as examples: As Jones points out, many of the plants in the garden are quite common and often planted by people who are unaware of their chemical properties.  “They’re very, very common plants,” he said. “In fact, a lot of them are what we call crossover garden plants. And they’re grown in many people’s gardens, but people don’t know how harmful they actually are.” In addition to common plants that are poisonous, the garden also hosts several narcotic or hallucinogenic plants. “The Duchess got government permission to grow plants like cannabis, opium poppies, magic mushrooms, and coca,” the website Atlas Obscura explained. While we cannot speak to the claim that this is properly categorized as “the most dangerous garden in the world,” the Poison Garden in Northumbria is a real place, and as such its existence is factual.","https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/07/10/the-plants-will-kill-you-the-alnwick-poison-garden-is-the-most-dangerous-garden-in-the-world-2/,https://www.facebook.com/thecelticgardenerwales/posts/170516174747026,https://www.scotsman.com/news/estate-play-controversial-gardens-alnwick-castle-have-become-something-lifes-work-duchess-northumberland-has-quest-fund-them-2466937,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tboW11dMeKs,https://web.archive.org/web/20160325032504/http://www.alnwickgarden.com:80/explore/whats-here/the-poison-garden/about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tboW11dMeKs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tboW11dMeKs,https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/curious-fact-of-the-week-alnwick-poison-gardens",Is the ‘Most Dangerous Garden in the World’ a Real Place?,,,,,,

However, whoever made it used some of photographer Sean Davey’s impressive work. Davey’s experience in surf photography spans around 40 years. In 2009, Davey explained on his website that he decided to come up with a Photoshop of a big wave headed for tall buildings in Honolulu, Hawaii: We created a GIF to show the comparison of Davey’s Photoshop work with the picture in question that was later created by an unknown person. Both of these images have been altered:  Some parts of the tall buildings were not completely removed for the picture of the crowded beach, as can be seen below:  The wave Davey used for his artistic creation was much smaller than it appeared in the two Photoshopped pictures. As for actual huge tsunami and tidal waves, we turned to the U.S. Geological Survey to learn the difference: In sum, the pictures of the huge tsunami hitting a crowded beach or Honolulu were both doctored.

Walker in a luxury automobile with three other women was circulated on social media along with the claim that Walker was the “first woman to become a millionaire” in the United States: This photograph is genuine and this claim is largely accurate. This photograph was taken circa 1911 and is available via the New York Public Library with the following description: “Madam C.J. Walker (driving) with (left to right) her niece Anjetta Breedlove, Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company factory forelady (manager) Alice Kelly, and Walker Company bookkeeper Lucy Flint.” The Indiana Historical Society writes that Walker, born Sarah Breedlove, suffered from hair loss, dandruff, and other common hair problems, which drove her to find a solution. In 1905, she developed “Madam C.J. Walker’s Wonderful Hair Grower” which she would then sell door to door, offering demonstrations of how to use the product:  The company grew — Walker would later build a factory, a distribution center, and start several beauty colleges — and by the time of her death in 1919, the company was bringing in annual revenue of over $500,000. The New York Age wrote after her death in 1919 that Walker was regarded at the time as the world’s richest Black woman with an estimated worth of more than $1 million. In addition to overseeing a very successful company, the paper noted that Walker also owned several pieces of real estate, including two properties in New York valued at $700,000 and $400,000.  1919-C.J. Walker-NY Age-31May19-Page 1 Sat, May 31, 1919 – Page 1 · The New York Age (New York, New York) · Newspapers.com While the Guinness Book of World Records lists Walker as the “first woman to earn a personal fortune of more than $1,000,000,” they note that it’s possible that another woman achieved the feat first. Some historians claim that Mary Ellen Pleasant, for instance, reached this milestone a decade before Walker’s passing. By some estimates, Pleasant, a Black woman who made her fortune investing in real estate and gold, may have amassed nearly $30 million (combined with her partner) before her death in 1904. While it isn’t entirely clear if Walker was the first woman to become a self-made millionaire, she was certainly one of the first.

Jim Jordan, a fierce Trump supporter, alleged in the below-displayed Facebook post that House Democrats intentionally “left out” footage of the former president telling supporters on Jan. 6 to “peacefully and patriotically” protest the outcome of the 2020 election.  The following day, Trump’s former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, echoed the allegation, tweeting: “There’s one line from President Trump’s January 6th speech that Democrats keep conveniently leaving out: ‘Peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.'” To investigate the claim, we first gathered evidence to confirm or disprove that Trump made the comment to supporters on Jan. 6. According to video footage by Bloomberg and a transcript by Factba.se of Trump’s remarks during the so-called “Save America Rally” at Ellipse Park near the White House around noon (EST) that day, the former president indeed said: He made that statement in the first half of the approximately 70-minute speech, which centered on baseless conspiracy theories advanced to convince Americans that he legally deserved another term in the White House. Later in the remarks, as some of his supporters started breaching security barriers surrounding the Capitol, the former president also said: In other words, it was true that Trump at one point told his supporters to “peacefully and patriotically” leave the pro-Trump event at Ellipse Park — which is directly south of the White House and a roughly 20-minute walk from the Capitol — and go to the Capitol to try to convince members of Congress to delay a constitutional vote affirming then-President-elect Joe Biden’s 2020 election win. Those were not his only directions to the crowd, however. In the same speech, he also used the following phrases while encouraging people to head to the Capitol and protest his election loss, according to the transcript and video of the speech: It’s a subjective call as to whether those comments were meant to condone violence and crimes — the opposite of telling people to march “peacefully and patriotically” — on the part of right-wing extremists without explicitly encouraging it. Next, to investigate the claim that Democrats omitted any reference to Trump’s “peacefully and patriotically” remark during the alleged video displayed on the first day of the impeachment trial, we sought access to the video compilation that Democratic House impeachment managers (a group of nine lawmakers appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi) presented in the Senate chamber as part of their opening presentations on Feb. 9, via CSPAN and The Guardian. Based on our scene-by-scene review of that roughly 13-minute video, Jordan’s allegation in the Facebook post was true: It did not include this authentic quote from the president at Ellipse Park: “peacefully and patriotically make your votes heard today.” The video montage did, however, include a portion of a video Trump posted to social media during the riot, in which he did not condemn the mob nor back down from his weeks-long misinformation campaign about the 2020 election, but rather told them to “go home in peace.”  Let us note here: As the trial continued into its second day, Democratic impeachment managers did acknowledge Trump’s more peaceable remarks, while attempting to remind viewers of the larger context. On Feb. 10, around 3:30 p.m. (EST) (hours after Meadows’ tweet), Rep. Madeleine Dean, a Democrat from Pennsylvania and impeachment manager, confirmed that Trump told supporters to “peacefully and patriotically” protest on Jan. 6, and played footage of that moment on the Senate floor. “One of President Trump’s key defenses focus on what he said for a few seconds, 15 minutes into the speech,” she said, and then played the clip, according to C-SPAN footage. “In a speech spanning almost 11,000 words — yes, we did check — that was the one time, the only time, president Trump used the word ‘peaceful’ or any suggestion of nonviolence.”","https://www.facebook.com/35499336459/posts/10159034024061460,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-11.36.32-AM.png,https://twitter.com/MarkMeadows/status/1359567041150283777,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht20eDYmLXU,https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-campaign-rally-the-ellipse-january-6-2021,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-tell-supporters-storm/,https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/11/04/live-updates-snopes-coverage-of-the-aftermath-of-the-2020-u-s-election/,https://www.snopes.com/collections/2020-election-collection/,https://www.npr.org/sections/trump-impeachment-trial-live-updates/2021/02/09/965914210/meet-the-house-managers-laying-out-the-case-to-impeach-donald-trump,https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4944572/house-impeachment-managers-video-compilation-january-6-attack-us-capitol,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2021/feb/09/democrats-play-montage-of-footage-from-capitol-siege-during-trump-impeachment-hearing-video,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-trump-say-he-loved-rioters/,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-4.01.51-PM.png,https://www.c-span.org/video/?508741-1/impeachment-trial&vod&start=0",Did Dems’ Video Omit Trump’s Telling Supporters To ‘Peacefully and Patriotically’ Protest at Capitol?,"2020 election, donald trump, Second Trump Impeachment",,,,,

The article originated from a website that describes its output as being humorous or satirical in nature, as follows: “The Business Standard News is a satirical site designed to parody the 24-hour news cycle.” Many supporters of Trump, and adherents to baseless conspiracy theories that President Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory was either illegitimate or the result of widespread fraud, have sought to distance themselves from the chaos and violence that took place at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, by claiming the events of that day were orchestrated by left-wing agents provocateurs, in particular, antifa. Snopes has debunked several strands of that theory. However, the “antifa temptresses” quotation, attributed to Lindell, was fabricated. Although the Business Standard News carries a “satire” disclaimer on its website, it does not appear on every article. As a result, screenshots of the fake Lindell article spread widely on social media, without a warning that its contents were made up and intended to be humorous. To illustrate the popularity of the article, the following is a selection of screenshots (all without any “satire” disclaimer) posted and shared on Facebook in February 2021:  For background, here is why we sometimes write about satire/humor.","https://archive.is/plj00,https://archive.is/1NjC2,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/kevin-seefried-democrat-biden/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-mob-capitol/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/antifa-facial-recognition-capitol/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cnn-antifa-capitol-riot/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/jake-angeli-viking-capitol-blm/,https://archive.is/cXRGj,https://archive.is/xnS2c,https://archive.is/yqx2T,https://www.facebook.com/search/photos/?q=%22antifa%20temptresses%22&f=AbpVZRSnc12JsJxzPLEU5Tp4WXaqb-a6epUrUUQKOJVxJANu2myRgBchXd11Bq_LNFWCniqv4ZvnQTsoAwAN8g9fnve3kCWFOurpL7m939v3HFF_Du8oLKsyeZBNvCGK2k2yj9RcBrrWVr-de9R1LBer,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-11-at-16.37.11.png,https://www.snopes.com/notes/why-we-include-humor-and-satire-in-snopes-com/",Did MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell Blame Capitol Attack on ‘Antifa Temptresses’?,Jan. 6 Capitol Riots,,,,,

In their statement, they thanked frontline healthcare workers and called for a moment of silence for the more than 440,000 people who died because of the pandemic. Some social media users said the president and first lady were booed by many fans in Raymond James Stadium as they spoke. In one video shared on Twitter, the sounds of boos can be heard as the president begins to speak. The video, however, is of a phone that is recording a television broadcast, rendering it low quality.   The video below also claims the crowd is booing the Bidens, but it is equally difficult to discern the boos amidst cheers and other noises: Other livestreams we watched did not register the sounds of boos during the president’s speech, making it difficult to determine how many in the crowd were booing him, and whether they were booing at all. Now This also shared a clip from CBS, where it was difficult to hear any boos over the Bidens’ speech: Another video shot from a different angle in the stadium, showing the Bidens speaking from a big screen above the crowd, captures some clapping during their speech, but it is also difficult to tell if people were also booing:  It is conceivable that among 25,000 Super Bowl attendees at the stadium, a number of them were booing the president, but there is no way to confirm or deny that at this time. If clearer evidence emerges from reputable sources like journalists present at the stadium, we will update this post.

And, as the 46th president took pen to paper, he required that all federal rules pending review that were submitted under the previous administration be frozen for at 60 days — among them, one aimed at reducing the cost of insulin and EpiPens. It is important to note that the freeze is temporary. Headlines run by some conservative-leaning news publications — such as The Federalist and The National Law Review — made the freeze appear to be a more permanent change, which remains to be determined. On Jan. 20, 2021, Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff Ronald Klain announced that any rules published in the Federal Register that had not yet taken effect would be postponed for the following 60 days to allow the new administration the opportunity to review “any questions of fact, law, and policy the rules may arise.” Considered the official daily “newspaper” of the federal government, the Office of the Federal Register, under the National Archives and Records Administration, publishes proposed rules and regulations — including executive orders — to allow the public an opportunity to review and comment on them. Executive orders such as the one in question are published in the Federal Register to explain how the president has instructed various executive agencies on how to manage operations. In July 2020, Trump signed a series of executive orders that he posited served as an end-all solution for lowering high premium prices of prescription drugs — including the price of insulin, which he claimed would “come down to just pennies a day.” Under the Executive Order on Access to Affordable Life-Saving Medications, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was required to make changes aimed at lowering the cost of EpiPens, or injectable epinephrine, for Americans with severe allergies and the cost of insulin for those diagnosed with diabetes. An important caveat to note is that Executive Order 13937, issued by Trump, had not yet been put into law. Though it was published in the federal register on Dec. 23, 2020, the order was not scheduled to go into effect until Jan. 22, 2021 — two days after Biden issued a freeze on all rules made by Trump that were not yet in effect. At the time of writing, the Biden administration has not commented on whether it intends to pass the order into law. According to a statement issued by HHS, the freeze will be in place until March 22, 2021.","https://apnews.com/article/us-who-support-006ed181e016afa55d4cea30af236227,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/535075-biden-recommits-us-to-paris-climate-accord,https://archive.is/eUKT8,https://archive.is/eh5GV,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/regulatory-freeze-pending-review/,https://archive.is/PWovQ,https://www.federalregister.gov/uploads/2011/01/fr_101.pdf,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/insulin-pennies-a-day-trump/,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-access-affordable-life-saving-medications/,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/07/29/2020-16623/access-to-affordable-life-saving-medications,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/23/2020-28483/implementation-of-executive-order-on-access-to-affordable-life-saving-medications,https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-01629.pdf","Did Biden Temporarily Freeze Trump Rule Lowering Insulin, EpiPen Prices?",,,,,,

Limbaugh’s passing prompted former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence to post a tweet commemorating him by saying, “America lost a Giant.”  Pence, an evangelical Christian, told Fox News that Limbaugh was “the anchor of conservatism” and said that Limbaugh served as his inspiration to go into talk radio before Pence got into politics. Throughout his long tenure as a commentator and broadcaster, Limbaugh has been criticized for espousing viewpoints that have been harmful, sexist, homophobic, and racist. For example, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, he downplayed the public health threat posed by the virus, claiming it was “being weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump.” He called former first daughter Chelsea Clinton, who was 12 years old at the time, a dog, compared NFL players to gang members, and conducted a segment on his radio show in which he mocked people dying from the AIDS virus. Limbaugh later stated he regretted the latter.

In the wake of his death, various quotes from his life on the airwaves were shared on social media. One such claim was that Limbaugh said that the novel coronavirus was nothing more than “the common cold.”  The claim was shared in multiple tweets on Twitter. It was also shared on Facebook. It’s true that Limbaugh said: “Yeah, I’m dead right on this. The coronavirus is the common cold, folks.” The quote was from Feb. 24, 2020. A transcript from part of “The Rush Limbaugh Show” on Feb. 24 was headlined: “Overhyped Coronavirus Weaponized Against Trump.” He also added: “Be very leery of this, folks. It probably is not what the media’s leading you to believe it is.” On March 9, U.S. President Donald Trump compared influenza to coronavirus. The tweet read: He compared the COVID-19 pandemic to the flu once again months later. These two tweets were somewhat similar to Limbaugh’s claim about the common cold. On March 12, Limbaugh said that “the one thing missing in all of this panic-driven coronavirus news” was “the number of deaths in the United States!” At the time, around 39 people were reported to have died of COVID-19 in the U.S. The headline of the transcript was: “Why Isn’t the Coronavirus Death Toll the Big Story?” However, this was misleading. News organizations were indeed reporting death numbers. On March 7, an NBC News story said that 19 people had died in the U.S. A CBS News article that was originally published on March 9 cited 26 deaths. CNN reported 38 deaths on March 11. On March 12, ABC News published a story that mentioned 40 deaths. From the first U.S. death on Feb. 6, 2020, and moving more than 12 months later, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the virus was far more deadly than the common cold or influenza. On Feb. 17, 2021, Johns Hopkins University of Medicine reported that the U.S. was preparing to surpass 500,000 deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic.","https://www.snopes.com/news/2021/02/17/rush-limbaugh-dies/,https://archive.vn/xe5Oo,https://archive.vn/bMprO,https://archive.vn/L842s,https://archive.vn/mvKC6,https://archive.vn/iMjsj,https://archive.vn/Q3E1z,https://archive.vn/MohaC,https://archive.vn/X0oP8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/06/210000-deaths-later-trump-reverts-comparing-coronavirus-flu/,https://archive.is/6gruz,https://archive.is/c7ViI,https://web.archive.org/web/20200318124717/https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2020/03/12/do-you-know-the-american-death-toll-from-coronavirus/,https://archive.is/HyD2W,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/live-blog/2020-03-07-coronavirus-news-n1152081,https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-updates-cases-fears-deaths-us-latest-2020-03-09/,https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-11-20-intl-hnk/index.html,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/coronavirus-live-updates-drastic-measures-issued-globally-pandemic/story?id=69551458,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/22/840836618/1st-known-u-s-covid-19-death-was-on-feb-6-a-post-mortem-test-reveals,https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html",Did Rush Limbaugh Downplay COVID as ‘the Common Cold’?,"COVID-19, Rush Limbaugh",,,,,

Roughly one year later, when he died on Feb. 17, 2021, Snopes readers turned to us to investigate whether that announcement — or anything else — led to his retirement or an official end to his broadcasting career. During the 2020 segment, the 69-year-old said doctors discovered the disease after he complained of some shortness of breath and that he was preparing to undergo treatment immediately, taking him off-air for a few days, multiple reputable news outlets reported. “It is what it is,” he reportedly said. “This has happened, and my intention is to come here every day I can.” Then, months later, he told listeners in another episode that his cancer was progressing, despite several treatment regimens. “It’s tough to realize that the days where I do not think I’m under a death sentence are over,” Limbaugh said in October, according to news reports. But Limbaugh said at that time that he intended to keep headlining the show, and he did. We found no evidence of Limbaugh announcing his retirement since his show debuted in 1988. He last hosted an episode on Feb. 2, 2021, before his death, according to video archives of the show. After that, guests rotated through the hosting spot, but there was no indication (whether in show notes or public statements) that Limbaugh would not return, or that he had officially ended his career in the public eye. According to former President Donald Trump, who called into Fox News Channel as news of Limbaugh’s death circulated, the broadcaster remained active in the high-profile conservative media sphere “till the very end,” and that they spoke three or four days prior to his death. For those reasons, we rate this claim “False.” At its peak, Limbaugh’s program drew in more than 20 million listeners. The National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame inducted him in 1998, and, in early 2020, Trump awarded Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Simultaneously, he was widely criticized for bigoted, racist, sexist, homophobic and false remarks.

The campaign pitch, made in some form by Jon Ossoff, Raphael Warnock, and Joe Biden leading up to that Jan. 5, 2021 election, was that a blue (Democrat-controlled) U.S. Senate would ensure passage of those $2,000 checks. On Jan. 20, Biden unveiled his $1.9 trillion COVID stimulus plan. It proposed issuing $1,400 checks to each person. Some have interpreted the $1,400 as a broken promise, despite the fact that the goal, since December, had always been to achieve a total per person payment of $2,000. The $600 checks already approved by Congress began disbursement starting on Dec. 29, 2020. Here, Snopes takes a granular look at the issue. On Dec. 22, 2020, President Donald Trump shocked congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle by threatening to block passage of a third COVID-19 stimulus package that had been negotiated for months and that his administration played a crucial role in shaping. The problem, Trump stated in a video Tweeted out that night, was that the $600 per person cap was not enough. “I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000 or $4,000 for a couple,” he said. In a confusing moment of limited bipartisanship, Democratic members of Congress agreed with Trump and launched a last-minute campaign to amend the relief bill to include the $2,000 checks requested by Trump. Congressional Republicans, for the most part, opposed the increase. An attempt to raise the amount, pushed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others, to the level Trump had requested failed on Dec. 24. Ultimately, Trump signed the originally negotiated bill — which included the $600 per person cap — on Dec. 27.    In response, on Dec. 28, Democrats in the House passed a stand-alone bill designed to make Trump’s vision of $2,000 per person a reality. The text of the bill proposed, in part, to amend the portion of the recently passed relief package “by striking ‘$600’ each place it appears and inserting ‘$2,000’, and by striking ‘$1,200’ each place it appears and inserting ‘$4,000.’ The move was described by The Associated Press at the time as “all but dar[ing] Republicans to break with Trump.” That “dare” came at a complicated political moment. The two run-off elections for Georgia would determine the balance of power in the Senate. Both Ossoff and Warnock capitalized on the moment, immediately pushing both their GOP rivals in Georgia to support the House bill upping the payment to $2,000. On Dec. 28, the same day that the House passed its proposed increase to COVID relief checks, Warnock tweeted that, “Georgians could have gotten $2,000 relief checks. You’re only getting $600 — because [opponent Kelly Loeffler] refused to fight for more.” That same day, Ossoff tweeted that his opponent “David Perdue didn’t even want the first round of stimulus checks.” On election day, Ossoff’s final pitch to voters included the statement, “We will be able to pass $2,000 stimulus checks for the people next week.” President-elect Biden had made the same general point a day earlier at a rally for Ossoff and Warnock. “By electing Jon and the reverend, you can make an immediate difference in your own lives,” Biden said on Jan. 4, “because their election will put an end to the block in Washington of that $2,000 stimulus check. That money that will go out the door immediately.” On Jan. 20, Biden revealed his COVID relief plan in an executive order calling for additional payments of $1,400 per person. This led some to interpret Biden, Warnock, and Ossoff’s pre-election discussion as a disingenuous bait-and-switch, promising a certain amount of money for votes and then refusing to deliver on that promise. “$2,000 means $2,000,” Ocasio-Cortez told The Washington Post following the release of the plan, “$2,000 does not mean $1,400.” Other critics accused Biden and Ossoff of “purchasing” peoples’ votes and then refusing to “pay up.” Those arguing that Biden et al. broke a political promise by proposing $1,400 checks on top of the already approved $600 ones misrepresent the political debate surrounding COVID-19 relief efforts. Until the “broken promise” talking point emerged, the two political “camps” were the $600 advocates (most congressional Republicans) and the $2,000 advocates (Trump and most congressional Democrats). At no point was there ever a “$2,600 camp.” Before the end of December, it appeared logistically possible to modify the amount of money mandated in the previous COVID-relief package through that House bill passed on Dec. 28. According to reporting in The New York Times, however, the Treasury Department “started making direct deposit payments” on Dec. 29, and started mailing checks the next day. Ocasio-Cortez, who suggested Biden’s plan did not fulfill the campaign promise of $2,000 checks, explicitly advocated the same solution on Dec. 23, proposing an amendment that would increase payments in the Trump package by $1,400 per person:  Looking back at the statements made by Biden and others, references to “$2,000 checks” must be to these legislative efforts — including those advocated for and voted on by Ocasio-Cortez. Because the Senate cannot “block” legislation that has not yet been proposed, Biden’s reference to “the block in Washington of that $2,000 stimulus check” clearly refers to the Senate’s unwillingness to take up the House amendment upping the $600 checks to $2,000. The end result of the solution Ocasio-Cortez, Biden, Ossoff and Warnock proposed or advocated for in late December would have been a total of $2,000 per person. The end result of the Biden package, if passed, would be a total of $2,000 per person. Indeed, the claim that any politician was arguing for a total of $2,600 per person in late December is completely untenable, and belied by Ocasio-Cortez’s support for the $2,000 solutions advocated for by herself and other Democrats at that time. The central issue is this: As the debate about the inadequacy of $600 checks versus $2,000 checks was raging in Congress, the $600 plan had already become law. Money was already being dispersed. To achieve the total of $2,000 advocated for by Trump and Democrats in late December, an additional payment of $1,400 passed through new legislation would be required. Biden’s plan, the specifics of which are currently being worked through in the House at the time of this reporting, would achieve that same end result. There is a plausible argument, however, that Biden and Ossoff over-promised regarding the rapidity with which a Biden administration and a blue Senate could bring about rapid disbursement of these funds. As the House has yet to approve the legislative package proposed by Biden, the money did not “go out the door immediately,” as Biden promised on Jan 4. Nor would that legislative package be passed, as Ossoff claimed it would, “the next week” after his election. The first $600 payments already approved have yet to reach many Americans. In late December 2020, Democrats united with Trump to push Congressional Republicans to increase COVID-19 stimulus payments from $600 to $2,000 per person. The universal call by those on the Left, at the time, was for a total of $2,000 per person. Ultimately, the $600 plan passed while the viability of $2,000 payments was still gaining traction. References to “$2,000 checks” made in January by Biden and by Georgia’s Democratic Senate candidates were to increase existing payments up to $2,000 — not to issue a new check for $2,000 in addition to the amount already approved. Because Biden and Ossoff’s statements are consistent with the package Democrats ultimately proposed, but because their timeline for getting those payments out the door was too optimistic, we rank the claim that Biden’s proposed $1,400 checks are a broken promise as “Mostly False.”","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-proposals-fact/factbox-bidens-covid-19-relief-plan-vs-senate-republicans-counter-proposal-idUSKBN2A13JS,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/legislation/2021/01/20/president-biden-announces-american-rescue-plan/,https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-politics-legislation-coronavirus-pandemic-bills-7d5b7e70e5193e88c6f24e425abbe0af,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWVptL9f230,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/24/house-votes-on-2000-stimulus-checks-after-trump-supports-them.html,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/12/27/trump-signs-900-b-covid-relief-package-he-called-disgrace/4023316001/,https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/9051/text,https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-politics-legislation-coronavirus-pandemic-bills-7d5b7e70e5193e88c6f24e425abbe0af,https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-politics-legislation-coronavirus-pandemic-bills-7d5b7e70e5193e88c6f24e425abbe0af,https://twitter.com/ReverendWarnock/status/1343678250413916161,https://twitter.com/ossoff/status/1343587859509473290,https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/14/biden-stimulus-covid-relief/,https://www.nytimes.com/article/stimulus-deal-update.html,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-23/ocasio-cortez-s-demand-for-2-000-checks-gets-trump-boost,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/aoc-2000-checks.png,https://streamable.com/jckvga,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/05/senate-passes-budget-resolution-toward-1point9-trillion-covid-relief-bill.html,https://www.nytimes.com/article/stimulus-deal-update.html","Did Biden, Ossoff, and Warnock Mislead Public With Promise of ‘$2000 Checks’?",Editor's Picks,,,,,

Limbaugh, for instance, had another segment that used former Congressman Barney Frank, a prominent gay politician, as fodder.

Limbaugh also spread the unfounded claim that gay men practiced “gerbilling” (you can read more about the unfounded urban legend here) and once said, according to James Retter’s book “The Anatomy of a Scandal,” that gay men “deserved their fate.”  The Media Matters site has noted that Limbaugh has a history of homophobic remarks.

In February 2020, the announcement drew attention to comments Limbaugh had made in 2015 on his show, denying known health risks associated with smoking. During the April 2015 segment, Limbaugh responded to a caller who stated that people are at risk of disease from second-hand smoke exposure. Limbaugh stated, falsely: But the World Health Organization stated the opposite of what Limbaugh claimed: Unlike cigarette smokers, cigar smokers typically don’t inhale smoke. However, per the Mayo Clinic, that doesn’t mean cigar smokers are at a reduced cancer risk.

We also could not find it on his website Rushlimbaugh.com.  As is often the case, it appears that this letter was circulating online before Limbaugh’s name was attached to it. The earliest iteration we could find was posted to Facebook in late November 2020. The letter was likely circulating before this date, however, as it talks about the 2020 election as a coming event, not a past one. In either case, the postings that we found in November and early December were attributed to an unknown third party. Additionally, these early versions did not start with a sentence saying that “my days on earth are numbered …” It seems that this sentence, as well as Limbaugh’s name, were subsequently added to this letter to make it more impactful.

This belief might have some validity in a strict linguistic sense, as the word is believed to be derived from a form of the French verb chanter, “to sing.” However, it is not the case (as often happens with linguistic borrowings) that “shanty” was originally spelled differently (e.g., “chanty”), and a “corrupt” or “wrong” spelling of the word eventually became the norm. The oldest known print references to sea shanties, from the mid-19th century, employed both the ‘sh’ and the ‘ch’ spellings, so neither was an “original” form that was later changed to something else. (And educated guess might be that the ‘ch’ version was faithful to the spelling of the original French root word, but the ‘sh’ version was a rendering of the French pronunciation of that word in English orthography.) In fact, the spelling of “shanty” has never been consistent in English, having been rendered variously as “shanty,” “chanty,” “chantey,” or (less frequently) “shantey.” The Google Books Ngram Viewer shows “shanty” as the far most common form over the last few decades:   This is one word that you can render in any of four different ways and still be “correct,” so all you aspiring singers can focus on your performances of these traditional sailing tunes and not worry too much about how to spell them.","http://www.folksong.org.nz/soon_may_the_wellerman/index.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/style/sea-shanty-tiktok-wellerman.html",Is It ‘Sea Shanty’ or ‘Sea Chanty’?,,,,,,

Kamala Harris as his Democratic running mate in the race against Republican incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence. Following that announcement, Trump and his supporters attempted to call attention to what they framed as immoral judgment by Harris — the Trump campaign alleged she wrongly encouraged Americans to help people who were arrested during protests over the police in-custody death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. For example, in an Aug. 17 speech to supporters in Mankato, Minnesota (which is about 80 miles southwest of Minneapolis), Trump said, according to a Factba.se transcription of the event: Less than two weeks later, U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, doubled down on the president’s claim, alleging in a tweet: “Kamala Harris helped violent rioters in Minnesota get out of jail to do more damage.”  Around the same time, at least one conservative website purported in a headline that Harris donated to the Minnesota Freedom Fund (MFF), which indeed gives cash to people who cannot afford bail so they don’t have to wait in jail until court hearings, or agree to high-interest loans. Over the course of months, numerous Snopes readers contacted us to investigate whether Harris had actually given money to the Minnesota-based organization, and, if so, whether those contributions allowed for any of the roughly 170 people who were arrested during protests to get out of jail and commit more crimes. First, let us identify what appeared to be the basis of those assertions. Following Floyd’s death, supporters of the civil rights movement nationwide (including many celebrities) donated more than $30 million to MFF, according to the nonprofit and news reports. High-profile donors used social media to promote their contributions, and Harris, on June 1, used her official accounts as a vice presidential candidate to express her support for the fundraising effort.  “If you’re able to, chip in now to the @MNFreedomFund to help post bail for those protesting on the ground in Minnesota,” she wrote on Facebook and Twitter, including links to an MFF donation page on the left-leaning fundraising site, ActBlue.  In other words, while it was true Harris publicly expressed support for the nonprofit and encouraged others to donate to it in summer 2020, she did not say on social media — or via any other public statement — that she herself donated money to the organization. Next, we analyzed how Harris’ 2020 campaign spent money and if, or to what extent, it helped the nonprofit, despite the fact she had not publicly declared the possible financial tie in a speech, interview, or on social media. Based on campaign filings compiled by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and Center for Responsive Politics, no expenditure receipt listed “Minnesota Freedom Fund” — debunking the possible claim that she used campaign money to help the nonprofit. Snopes reached out to MFF, asking if Harris at any point donated money and, if so, for the contribution’s details. Greg Lewin, the organization’s interim executive director, responded to us via email: “No, we have nothing in our records indicating a donation from Vice President Harris.” We also reached out to Harris’ press secretary, Symone Sanders, to comment on critics’ accusations, but we have not heard back. We will update this report when or if we do. (As part of a wide-sweeping proposal to reform the country’s criminal justice system, the Biden-Harris administration has pledged to eliminate the country’s cash-bail system.) Now, let us move to the latter claim regarding the people who MFF helped during the protests, in light of Harris’ June 1 posts praising the organization’s work. Established in 2016, MFF is among the many nonprofits that attempt to counteract inequities in the country’s cash-bail system by paying detainees’ criminal and immigration bonds. Then, when those people attend court proceedings to determine the outcome of their case — or whether they indeed broke the law prior to their arrest — they must return the full value of the cash bail to the Minnesota-based nonprofit. The MFF website states: Like in dozens of U.S. cities where people protested Floyd’s death, peaceful marches during the day between May 26 and early June set the stage for vandalism and destruction at night. However, the overwhelming majority of people who were arrested during the large gatherings — whether chaotic or peaceful — did not need the MFF’s help. Citing accounting by the American Bail Coalition (a trade group of insurance companies who profit from underwriting bail bonds) and Hennepin County jail records, The Washington Post reported in September that all but three of the 170 people arrested during the protests were released from jail within a week. Of the 167 released, only 10 had to put up a monetary bond to be released, and, in most cases, the amounts were nominal, such as $78 or $100. In fact, 92 percent of those arrested did not have to pay bail — and 29 percent of those arrested did not face charges, the news outlet reported. “We have paid all the protest bails that have come our way,” the MFF website said. “[Many] of the people who were arrested during the uprising weren’t detained and instead were given citations then released, have been released with no bail, or held with no bail.” However, among the small group of people who did receive direct bail assistance from the nonprofit, one man was arrested on suspicion of shooting at police with an AK-47-style mini Draco pistol in the early hours of May 30, as well as a woman who allegedly stole from a cell phone store in a Minneapolis suburb and other businesses the day prior, according to The Washington Post and other news reports. As of September, the nonprofit paid $75,000 in cash to help the former suspect and $750 to assist the latter. Additionally, a 32-year-old man whom MFF bailed out on an assault charge in July — a case that was unrelated to the protests — was charged with committing third-degree assault the following month, leaving the victim with a traumatic brain injury and a fractured skull, according to news reports. Lewin said in a statement afterward that the organization needs to “strengthen our internal procedures” to ensure its clients stay out of the criminal justice system after their first go-around. In sum, while Harris indeed expressed public support for MFF following Floyd’s death, it was false to claim she donated money to the organization, or that it helped protesters “get out of jail and do more damage,” like Cotton alleged. Rather, no evidence existed to show the handful of people who received direct bail assistance for arrests related to the demonstrations committed more crimes after their initial detainment. For those reasons, we rate this claim “Mostly false.”","https://www.snopes.com/collections/2020-election-claims-on-biden/,https://www.snopes.com/collections/the-kamala-harris-collection/,https://www.snopes.com/collections/2020-election-claims-on-trump/,https://www.snopes.com/collections/2020-election-claims-on-pence/,https://www.snopes.com/collections/george-floyd-rumor-collection/,https://factba.se/trump/search#minnesota%2Bfreedom%2Bfund,https://twitter.com/SenTomCotton?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor,https://twitter.com/TomCottonAR/status/1300230112407945216,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-2.28.03-PM.png,https://pjmedia.com/election/tyler-o-neil/2020/08/17/savage-trump-slams-kamala-harris-for-donating-to-bail-out-rioters-and-looters-n800874,https://variety.com/2020/film/news/celebrities-donate-minnesota-freedom-fund-1234621113/,https://mnfreedomfund.org/frequently-asked-questions,https://www.facebook.com/KamalaHarris/posts/if-youre-able-to-chip-in-now-to-the-minnesota-freedom-fund-to-help-post-bail-for/10158943194687923/,https://twitter.com/MNFreedomFund?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-3.30.32-PM.png,https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/?committee_id=C00694455&two_year_transaction_period=2020&data_type=processed,https://www.opensecrets.org/2020-presidential-race/kamala-harris/expenditures?id=N00036915,https://joebiden.com/justice/,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/business/cash-bail-system-reform.html,https://mnfreedomfund.org/frequently-asked-questions,https://ambailcoalition.org/blog/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/03/kamala-harris-tweeted-support-bail-fund-money-didnt-just-assist-protestors/,https://mnfreedomfund.org/frequently-asked-questions,https://www.centuryarms.com/mini-draco-pistol.html,https://ccxmedia.org/news/brooklyn-center-woman-accused-of-looting-riot/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/03/kamala-harris-tweeted-support-bail-fund-money-didnt-just-assist-protestors/,https://ccxmedia.org/news/brooklyn-center-woman-accused-of-looting-riot/,https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/08/26/minneapolis-man-lionel-timms-accused-in-serious-assault-after-being-bailed-out-by-mn-freedom-fund/,https://mnfreedomfund.org/updates",Did Kamala Harris Bail Out ‘Violent Rioters’ During George Floyd Protests?,"George Floyd, George Floyd Protests",,,,,

Limbaugh also spread the unfounded claim that gay men practiced “gerbilling” (you can read more about the unfounded urban legend here) and once said, according to James Retter’s book “The Anatomy of a Scandal,” that gay men “deserved their fate.”  The Media Matters site has noted that Limbaugh has a history of homophobic remarks. As recently as 2015, Limbaugh was making the argument that marriage equality would lead to bestialities.","https://www.snopes.com/tag/rush-limbaugh/,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/aids-update.jpg,https://www.newspapers.com/clip/71309533/,https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001880.htm#:~:text=From%201981%20through%201990%2C%20100%2C777,deaths%20were%20reported%20during%201990.,https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/16/magazine/the-rush-hours.html,https://www.newspapers.com/clip/71311697/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/richard-gere-gerbil/,https://archive.org/details/anatomyofscandal00rett,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/limbaugh-quote.jpg,https://www.mediamatters.org/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaughs-homophobic-comments-against-pete-buttigieg-are-part-long-anti-lgbtq",Did Rush Limbaugh’s ‘AIDS Update’ Mock the Deaths of Gay People?,Rush Limbaugh,,,,,

Keep scrolling to see our analysis for each: We looked for documentation for each of these statements. Here’s what we found: “I mean, let’s face it, we didn’t have slavery in this country for over 100 years because it was a bad thing. Quite the opposite: slavery built the South. I’m not saying we should bring it back; I’m just saying it had its merits. For one thing, the streets were safer after dark.” The only source we’ve turned up so far that putatively documents this quote is the 2006 book 101 People Who Are Really Screwing America, which attributed it to Rush Limbaugh but cited no source. On his program of 12 October 2009, Limbaugh disclaimed this quote as a fabricated one: “You know who deserves a posthumous Medal of Honor? James Earl Ray. We miss you, James. Godspeed.” Likewise, this statement is attributed (without sourcing) to Limbaugh in 101 People Who Are Really Screwing America. Although it is often cited as something he said on his radio program on 23 April 1998, we haven’t turned up any references to this quote from earlier than 2005. “Right. So you go into Darfur and you go into South Africa, you get rid of the white government there. You put sanctions on them. You stand behind Nelson Mandela — who was bankrolled by communists for a time, had the support of certain communist leaders. You go to Ethiopia. You do the same thing.” Media Matters for America documented this statement (with an audio clip) as one made by Rush Limbaugh in the course of his radio program on 21 August 2007. “Look, let me put it to you this way: the NFL all too often looks like a game between the Bloods and the Crips without any weapons. There, I said it.” Rush Limbaugh is credited as saying this in the transcript of his radio program on 19 January 2007. “The NAACP should have riot rehearsal. They should get a liquor store and practice robberies.” This putative statement dates at least as far back as 1992, so the only documentation we’ve been able to locate for it is indirect. All the sources we’ve found that reference it cite the January 1993 issue of Flush Rush Quarterly as their source. “[Blacks are] 12 percent of the population. Who the hell cares?” This statement has been indirectly referenced as something Rush Limbaugh once said on the air since at least as far back as 2000, but we have found no documenting source for it. “Have you ever noticed how all composite pictures of wanted criminals resemble Jesse Jackson?”  “Take that bone out of your nose and call me back.” Rush Limbaugh acknowledged making these statements in a 1990 Newsday article (although the latter, at least, occurred not on Limbaugh’s now-familiar talk and political commentary radio program, but at the beginning of his broadcast career back in the early 1970s when he was hosting a Top 40 music show under the name “Jeff Christie” on either WIXZ or KQV in Pittsburgh): “I think the media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well. They’re interested in black coaches and black quarterbacks doing well. I think there’s a little hope invested in McNabb and he got a lot of credit for the performance of his team that he really didn’t deserve.” Rush Limbaugh made this statement about Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb during a September 2003 broadcast of ESPN television’s Sunday NFL Countdown program. The controversy generated by the remark prompted Limbaugh’s resignation from his position as a commentator on that show.","https://www.snopes.com/tag/rush-limbaugh/,https://web.archive.org/web/20190903064136/https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2009/10/12/a_response_to_hateful_slander/,https://web.archive.org/web/20091019113523/http://mediamatters.org/mobile/research/200708230008,https://web.archive.org/web/20121017194354/https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2007/01/19/the_classless_nfl_culture/,https://web.archive.org/web/20190913223423/https://fair.org/article/limbaugh-a-color-man-who-has-a-problem-with-color/,https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.dailynews.com/2013/10/02/rush-limbaughs-former-life-as-a-dj-and-what-he-thinks-about-the-state-of-radio-today/,http://user.pa.net/~ejjeff/christie.html,https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=1627887",Did Rush Limbaugh Utter All These ‘Racist’ Statements?,Rush Limbaugh,,,,,

The headline for the story read: “Military-Hating Kamala Wants To Shut Down The VA.” It posited that she was planning to shutter VA facilities.

It was preceded in the Facebook posts with the words: “OK, NOW I’M PISSED!!!

29,,,,True,Dan Evon,2020-02-12,,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/author/dan/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rush-limbaugh-chelsea-clinton/,Radio host Rush Limbaugh once referred to 12-year-old Chelsea Clinton as a dog.,2020-02-12,snopes,,"When radio host Rush Limbaugh was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by U.S. President Donald Trump during the State of the Union address in February 2020, many critics derided the decision and noted that the conservative pundit had a long history of racist and controversial remarks. A series of quotes that Limbaugh ostensibly uttered over the years started to circulate on social media (some real, some fake), including one report about how the radio host once called former first daughter Chelsea Clinton a dog.   Limbaugh truly did once refer to young Chelsea as a dog.  When we attempted to track down the origins of this claim we came across two examples of Limbaugh making such a reference. The first was a viral quote: “Socks is the White House cat. But did you know there is also a White House dog?” – Rush Limbaugh, holding a pic of 13-year-old Chelsea Clinton on TV, 1993.”  The second was a video clip containing a similar insult. In the clip, Limbaugh says, “Let’s see who is the cute kid in the White House,” and then he shows a picture of a dog: We have been unable to find audio, video, or an official transcript for the viral quote starting “Socks is the White House cat.” However, the remark wasn’t conjured out of thin air. This quote was first reported on by Molly Ivins in an Oct. 17, 1993, article published in the Arizona Republic entitled “Riding the Powerless for a Laugh.” Ivins wrote (emphasis ours): A clipping of this newspaper article appears below:  Ivins provided no information about when Limbaugh made this remark, and it’s unclear if this was a paraphrased version of something he said or a direct quote.  As for the viral video clip, the segment reportedly aired on Nov. 6, 1992. President Bill Clinton had just won election and Limbaugh was commenting on a New York Daily News article about what was coming “IN” to the White House with the Clinton family and what was going “OUT” of the White House with the Bush family.  Here’s a transcript of the segment from Media Matters: This segment was also featured in a 1995 Frontline special entitled “Rush Limbaugh’s America.”  While we haven’t found video of the full segment, a transcript shows how Limbaugh launched into an attack on another former White House child (he called Amy Carter, the daughter of President Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn Carter, the “the most unattractive presidential daughter in the history of the country”) and then “apologized” for the Chelsea Clinton mix-up, blaming the crew for showing a picture of a dog instead of Chelsea. Here’s a transcript of the show (emphasis ours): Limbaugh issued another apology a few days later on his show: It’s possible that Limbaugh referred to Chelsea as a dog twice. The first, shortly after Bill Clinton’s presidential election in November 1992. And the second, sometime in 1993. However, it seems likely that the quote reported by Ivins (starting “Everyone knows the Clintons have a cat”) is a paraphrased version of Limbaugh’s comments from 1992.","https://www.snopes.com/tag/rush-limbaugh/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rush-limbaugh-racist-quotes/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rush-limbaugh-michael-j-fox/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rush-limbaugh-troops-welfare-queens/,https://twitter.com/JohnFugelsang/status/1224893965872308225,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/02/limbaugh-chelsea-dog.png,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/02/Limbaugh-quote-tweet.png,https://www.newspapers.com/clip/44104416/,https://www.mediamatters.org/rush-limbaugh/flashback-when-rush-limbaughs-hate-was-televised,https://www.mediamatters.org/rush-limbaugh/flashback-when-rush-limbaughs-hate-was-televised",Did Rush Limbaugh Refer to 12-Year-Old Chelsea Clinton as a Dog?,Rush Limbaugh,,,,,
