The truth is a bit nuanced. Yes, Amazon did opt in devices that are eligible for Amazon Sidewalk, but customers can likewise choose to opt out. And if you are on Amazon Sidewalk, that doesn’t mean your Wi-Fi is shared with all of your neighbors. A small portion of Wi-Fi bandwidth will be shared only with other Amazon Sidewalk customers. We will explain more in detail below. Technology site CNET described Amazon Sidewalk as “a long-range wireless network capable of keeping things connected even when they’re outside the typical range of home Wi-Fi.” According to Amazon: Sidewalk is intended to beef up Amazon’s network of Wi-Fi-operated devices so that they will work even outside the range of the device owner’s home Wi-Fi. Per CNET: It’s true that when Amazon Sidewalk goes live on June 8, 2021, customers that own eligible Sidewalk Bridge devices will be automatically opted in, initially. But they also have the option of opting out at any time.  According to Amazon, Sidewalk Bridge devices provide connections to Amazon Sidewalk network, and these devices are: Amazon spokesman Jeremy Bartram told Snopes in an email that the company began notifying Amazon customers with eligible devices, so they could evaluate whether they wanted to change their preferences before Amazon Sidewalk goes online. Yes, but not all neighbors and only a small portion of your Wi-Fi bandwidth. According to Amazon, Sidewalk will enable Wi-Fi sharing only between customers who own Sidewalk-connected Amazon devices. It will also share a fraction of a customer’s Wi-Fi. Bartram told us that, “when you share your Bridge’s connection with Sidewalk, total monthly data used by Sidewalk, per account, is capped at 500MB, which is equivalent to streaming about 10 minutes of high definition video.” Bartram said Amazon took multiple security measures including three layers of encryption on data and measures to prevent customers from viewing other customers’ data. More details on security measures can be viewed here.","https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/amazon-sidewalk-launches-june-8-with-support-for-tile-trackers/,https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Sidewalk/b?ie=UTF8&node=21328123011#:~:text=The%20benefits%20of%20Amazon%20Sidewalk,to%20you%20and%20your%20neighbors.,https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Sidewalk/b?ie=UTF8&node=21328123011,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/sidewalk/privacy_security_whitepaper.pdf",Is Amazon Sidewalk Going To Share Wi-Fi with Neighbors Without Permission?,,,,,,

Benny Johnson posted a video in which he said Harris was, in her tweet, “spitting on the graves of our fallen,” while Mark Kaye said: Facebook users, primarily critical of Harris’ tweet, enthusiastically shared screenshots of it over the course of the weekend, as shown below:  Those criticisms referred to an authentic tweet. On May 29, Harris did indeed tweet “Enjoy the long weekend” from the @VP account, along with a photograph of herself smiling. As such, we are issuing a rating of “Correct Attribution.” However, this was far from the extent of her pronouncements on Memorial Day weekend in 2021. At 7 a.m. EST on May 30, Harris wrote on Twitter:  And on Memorial Day itself at 5:18 p.m. EST, Harris posted what appeared to be a photograph of Arlington National Cemetery, along with the following message:  Between Harris’s May 30 tweet about the “service and sacrifice” of members of the U.S. armed forces and June 1, Johnson published no fewer than eight Facebook posts and videos castigating her “Enjoy the long weekend” tweet. None of them mentioned, even in passing, that the vice president had since said much more about Memorial Day. Similarly, Kaye’s video, in which he criticized Harris for failing to mention Memorial Day, fallen service members, freedom, and so on, was posted on June 1 — after Harris had mentioned all those things in two subsequent tweets. As of June 1, neither the New York Post nor Fox News had updated their articles to include the fact that Harris posted in detail about the sacrifices of U.S. service members, and the ethos of Memorial Day, on May 30 and 31.","https://archive.is/E0JpP,https://archive.is/WwcoH,https://archive.is/Vtxn0,https://www.facebook.com/search/photos/?q=%22enjoy%20the%20long%20weekend%22%20kamala&sde=Abp4I_vF6erxJKN83L2asL-ZNs4QNrvL1CQupF82sSs31dRjA9153NWEu3AJQGvTdKIidZfberS6E637bLzrR-DRYbZI4CYCfLJuiPEOafkSGhtxcfIMKHh8VpY7tu76eD3oPKXBeqDcDXKxx9q8_MM7,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-01-at-15.32.38.png,https://archive.is/2hMcx,https://archive.is/87qWj,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-01-at-16.34.07.png,https://archive.is/74LVC,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-01-at-16.46.14.png",Did Kamala Harris Tweet ‘Enjoy the Long Weekend’ Before Memorial Day?,"Kamala Harris, memorial day",,,,,

The offer of 90% off supposedly only lasted for 24 hours. Ray-Ban sunglasses cost hundreds of dollars, so such a sale would mean huge savings for consumers. This was not a legitimate offer from Ray-Ban. It is a dangerous scam. It’s been going around for several years, including on Tumblr. Tweets that promoted the scam read: “Friends, the surprise is coming. Are you interested?” They appeared to involve phishing attempts that pulled follower names from a user’s follower list. This caused the scam to virally spread. The scammers appeared to gain access to social media accounts after users visited the dangerous website that appeared in this image: We strongly advise against visiting the website. Providing information to scammers could lead to identity theft and other harmful outcomes. While the image did say that the scam website was Ray-Ban’s “official website,” this was false. The 5-letter website that appeared in the social media postings began with “rb,” as in “rb—.com.” We have removed the last three letters from the website address so as to not encourage readers to visit the fake website. This was not an official Ray-Ban website. The official Ray-Ban website is ray-ban.com. The company is owned by Luxottica. As of June 1, 2021, the official Ray-Ban Twitter account had not tweeted about the resurgence of the anniversary sale scam. However, a search for past tweets showed other 5-letter scam websites that also began with “rb—.com,” except with other combinations of three letters following “rb.” Scammers have often used the ploy that major companies (like Ray-Ban) are having anniversary sales in order to trick consumers into falling into the trap. We’ve reported on a seemingly endless number of these scams in the past. For example, Aldi, Tim Hortons, Taco Bell, and Walmart have all been used in anniversary sale scams, to name a few. We’ve even seen vacation scams on Facebook for getaways to Bora Bora and Las Vegas that may have tricked people into sharing the fake giveaways. In sum, Ray-Ban nor Luxottica is not offering 90% off sunglasses for 24 hours for its 84th anniversary, or any anniversary.","https://archive.ph/tugTR,https://twitter.com/kindlestuck/status/1399529940748443650,https://www.ray-ban.com/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/does-luxottica-own-80-of-the-eyeglass-industry/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDdq2rIqAlM,https://twitter.com/ray_ban/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/company-anniversary-free-product-scam/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/aldi-facebook-scam/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/tim-hortons-facebook-scam/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/taco-bell-facebook-anniversary/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/walmart-anniversary-coupon-scam/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bora-bora-getaway-facebook/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/las-vegas-travel-facebook-vacation/",Are Ray-Ban Sunglasses 90% Off for an Anniversary Sale?,,,,,,

Those reports contained accurate descriptions of what Flynn said at a conference in Dallas, Texas, over the weekend of May 28-30, 2021. However, Flynn quickly backtracked on his remarks, writing online, “There is NO reason whatsoever for any coup in America.” As a result, we are issuing a rating of “Mixture.” The remarks in question came during a panel discussion at the “For God & Country Patriot Roundup” in Dallas, Texas, which took place between May 28 and 31, 2021. Video footage of Flynn’s comments first emerged online on May 30, which suggests that was the date on which he made them, though we have not yet been able to verify that definitively. Two separate video clips posted to Twitter show the following exchange between an unnamed audience member, and Flynn:  In February, military leaders in the southeast Asian nation of Myanmar (also known as Burma), carried out a coup. It was to this that the audience member referred when he asked why “what happened in Minamar [Myanmar] can’t happen” in the United States. Flynn’s response — “No reason. I mean, it should happen” — clearly meant he was expressing support, at least in principle, for a military coup in the United States. News reports that characterized his remarks in that way were therefore accurate. However, on May 31 Flynn appeared to backtrack on those comments. On the social media platform Telegram, he wrote:  Sidney Powell, an attorney who represents Flynn, confirmed for Snopes that @RealGenFlynn is an authentic Telegram account and that the May 31 message was composed by Flynn himself. In writing, “There is no reason it (a coup) should happen here (in America),” Flynn was not “repeating” his response at the conference. In reality, he said the opposite at the conference. But it remains the case that, shortly afterwards, he clearly articulated opposition to the idea of a military coup in the United States.

But Lake St. Louis police stated that the sign wasn’t posted by anyone associated with the restaurant.

When outlets such as The Independent reported this news, they noted that Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, issued no such proclamations during his tenure in office: It’s true that Trump never issued a presidential proclamation in recognition of Pride Month. We searched the National Archives database of proclamations, as well as the Trump White House archives, and found no proclamations issued in honor of Pride Month. In June 2020, NBC News reported that Trump had issued proclamations designating June as “National Homeownership Month, Great Outdoors Month, and Caribbean-American Heritage Month,” but never as Pride Month.  While Trump never issued an official proclamation for Pride Month, he was the first sitting Republican president to publicly recognize Pride Month, albeit in a less official manner. In May 2019, Trump posted a series of tweets to “celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation.”  These tweets are no longer available online, as Trump was kicked off of the social media platform in early 2021 amid fears that he would incite further violence after the attack on the U.S. Capitol. An archived version of the tweets is available and the text is reproduced below: This message was also released as a statement from the White House. Although Trump was the first Republican president to recognize Pride Month in this tweet, contemporaneous news articles noted that this message was posted even as Trump’s administration worked to rescind federal protections from transgender individuals: Former U.S. President Bill Clinton was the first president to issue a proclamation for Pride Month. On June 11, 1999, Clinton issued “Proclamation 7203: Gay and Lesbian Pride Month,” which read: Clinton’s successor, George W.

This image was edited to make it look as if there is a dotted pattern on Perdita’s fur resembling a swastika.  We viewed a copy of “101 Dalmatians” available via Disney Plus and can confirm that this swastika pattern does not appear in the official version of the film.  A clip of this scene is also available via YouTube. It’s clear that Perdita, in the blue collar on the left, does not have dots shaped in the form of a swastika on her fur: The fake “101 Dalmatians” swastika image has been circulating since at least 2015 when the website Hexjam included it in an article about “subliminal messages you never noticed in Disney movies.” The images included in this article were all fakes, however, and featured far-fetched jokes such as a dwarf smoking a marijuana cigarette in “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” and former U.S. President George W. Bush’s face appearing in “Alice in Wonderland.” Hexjam noted at the top of the article that viewers probably never noticed these images because they didn’t actually appear in the Disney films. This is not the first time a digitally edited still from a Disney movie has been created to make it seem as if the animators had secretly slipped a tasteless joke into a PG movie. “Toy Story 3,” for example, does not feature a hidden image of oral sex, “The Lion King” doesn’t feature a hidden image of breasts, and “Monsters Inc.” does not feature a drawing of sex.

At the time of this writing, the video had been liked more than 4.8 million times.    The magnitude of the shark’s size was made visible by its comparison to the people standing along the deck of the ship, prompting some users to suggest the seemingly impossible: that the animal in question was a now-extinct marine giant that once swam the ancient seas, a megalodon. Nicknamed “The Meg” by a 2018 science-fiction flick of the same name, the megalodon clocks in as the world’s largest shark. Megalodon fossils date back to 20 million years ago, and not only was the megalodon (scientific name Otodus megalodon) the largest shark on Earth, but the Natural History Museum reported that it was also one of the largest fish to ever exist — measuring up to 36 feet in length and three times longer than the white shark. It is important to note that estimates of megalodon size are not definitive, as a complete fossil specimen has never been found.  The megalodon went extinct around 3.8 million years ago. As such, other TikTok users suggested that the shark in the video may have been a basking shark, the second largest fish in the world, second only to the whale shark, according to the oceanic conservation group Oceana. Snopes spoke with John McCosker, the chairman of aquatic biology at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, who said that the animal in the TikTok was indeed a “big shark,” but was likely not a basking shark.  “It is probably a white shark (to call it a great white shark is just hyperbolic), which exists in those waters. I suspect that it is as large as 18 feet, but there is no way to calculate accurately from that photo,” said McCosker.  A look through the scientific literature confirmed what McCosker said. The white shark, scientific name Carcharodon carcharias, can weigh up to 6,600 pounds and grow to a maximum size of around 20 feet in length, noted Oceana. (However, the Smithsonian Institute reports that average female measures around 16 feet long, while males typically reach about 13 feet.)   “Great white sharks are opportunistic predators, feeding from the ocean’s surface to the seafloor. As great white sharks grow in size, so does the range of their prey,” said Oceana. “Smaller great whites prey on fish, rays, and crustaceans and when they are larger also eat seals, sea lions, dolphins, seabirds, marine turtles, rays, and other sharks.” What remains unclear is why the shark was circling the ship in the first place. Snopes contacted the original poster of the video, Albrecht, to receive more information about where the video was taken but did not receive a response in time for publication. We will update the article accordingly if we hear back.","https://archive.vn/Xh9KF,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4779682/,https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/megalodon--the-truth-about-the-largest-shark-that-ever-lived.html,https://oceana.org/marine-life/sharks-rays/basking-shark,https://usa.oceana.org/fun-facts-about-great-white-sharks,https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/sharks-rays/how-big-are-great-white-sharks,https://usa.oceana.org/fun-facts-about-great-white-sharks",Did a Megalodon Stalk a Cruise Ship?,,,,,,

And yet another hangover “cure” went viral in May 2021 after a Twitter user shared a photo of an asparagus bunch on May 22. A tag attached to the vegetable bundle told consumers, “Eating asparagus before you start drinking can help protect your liver. Its minerals and amino acids not only protect the liver from toxins, the enzymes in asparagus can help break down the alcohol and alleviate hangovers.”  That claim can be traced back to a 2009 study published in the Journal of Food Science by the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT), a forum of science and food professionals. Based on the evidence presented in the research, we determined this claim to be a mixture due to the fact that the scientists found that asparagus extract helped to alleviate the effects of alcohol in cultured human cells — not actual humans. While these findings suggested that consuming asparagus could help alleviate the effects of an alcohol hangover and protect the liver against some toxins, it is unknown whether eating asparagus in its pure form before, after, or while drinking alcohol will immediately help soothe a hangover, and if so, to what extent. The researchers credit Asparagus officinalis, the species of asparagus they used in the 2009 study, for anti-cancer effects, as well as antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and diuretic properties. Its roots and shoots consist of health-promoting plant compounds like flavonoids, carbohydrates known as oligosaccharides, and protein-building amino acid derivatives. To determine whether A. officinalis might also be considered a “supplement for the alleviation of alcohol hangover,” researchers at the Institute of Medical Science and Jeju National University in Korea analyzed components of young asparagus shoots and leaves to compare the biochemical effect on human and rat liver cells — not humans. The researchers collected asparagus from several different farms in Korea, air-dried the shoots and leaves from young plants and then extracted their compounds and injected them into rat and human cells that had been cultured in Petri dishes (known as HepG2), some of which contained the key chemical found in alcohol, ethanol. (For comparison, the asparagus extract was also compared with two commercial hangover drinks available on the market at the time, Condition and Dawn808, for controls.) Chronic alcohol use can cause oxidative stress on the liver, which is responsible for metabolizing ethanol through two key enzymes, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase. Higher concentrations of a metabolite of ADH called acetate can cause toxic effects of alcohol — also known as hangover symptoms. But when treated with asparagus extract, these two enzymes worked nearly twice as effectively to essentially detoxify the liver cells. “Cellular toxicities were significantly alleviated in response to treatment with the extracts of asparagus leaves and shoots,” said lead researcher B.Y. Kim in a news release at the time of the study. “These results provide evidence of how the biological functions of asparagus can help alleviate alcohol hangover and protect liver cells.” Although the scientists did not compare other species of asparagus, they note that the antioxidant activity of A. officinalis observed in this study was “potent enough” to provide biochemical evidence that asparagus may alleviate alcohol hangover and protect liver cells against toxins. They also noted that asparagus leaves, which are normally chucked out, contain higher levels of amino acids and inorganic mineral contents that could also be therapeutically beneficial. Snopes contacted the IFT to determine if there have been additional or more recent studies regarding whether asparagus can help to alleviate the effects of a hangover.

9,,,,What's False,Dan MacGuill,2021-05-30,,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/author/danmacguill/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pennsylvania-miscarriage-fine/,"Pennsylvania House Bill 118 of 2021 would fine women who have a miscarriage, or force them to pay for a fetal death certificate.",2021-05-30,snopes,,"In May 2021, a Democratic U.S. Senate candidate from Pennsylvania posted a widely shared condemnation of state lawmakers who she claimed had “voted to fine women who miscarry,” as well as forcing them to apply for a fetal death certificate:  Val Arkoosh, chairwoman of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners and one of several Democratic candidates seeking to replace retiring Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, posted the same message to Facebook on May 25, and offered further details in a short Instagram video, in which she said the bill in question: Arkoosh did not stipulate the legislation to which she was referring and did not respond to an inquiry from Snopes, but she appears to have had in mind Pennsylvania House Bill 118, which was one of three pieces of legislation voted through by a Republican majority on the House Health Committee earlier that day. HB 118 did not introduce a fine for women who have a miscarriage, nor did it introduce a requirement for them to pay for, or obtain, a fetal death certificate. The specific claims made by Arkoosh, in her widely shared tweet, were therefore inaccurate. However, the legislation did propose introducing new requirements and expanding existing ones for healthcare providers. If implemented, HB 118 could require healthcare providers to bury or cremate any and all fetal remains after a miscarriage or abortion, no matter how early in the pregnancy, and to file a fetal death certificate with the state of Pennsylvania, on penalty of a fine or even imprisonment. The process of filing a fetal death certificate is very likely to involve consultation and discussion with women who may strongly prefer not to take any part in discussions about such arrangements, and therefore HB 118 was likely, if implemented, to multiply the trauma inflicted on such women, in the state of Pennsylvania. We are therefore issuing a rating of “Mostly False.” Obligations on Healthcare Providers and Patients Under existing Pennsylvania law, specifically Article V of the Vital Statistics Law of 1953, healthcare providers are required to take a number of actions in the event of a fetal death, whether through miscarriage, abortion, or ectopic pregnancy. Firstly, they must file a fetal death certificate within four business days. Secondly, after the death is officially registered, they must apply for a “permit for disposal” and dispose of the remains. If an adult has died, these steps are typically taken by a funeral director, in collaboration with family members. But in the event of a fetal death, it’s a healthcare provider who typically registers the death and disposes of the fetal remains.  Pennsylvania law does not require patients to file a fetal death certificate or obtain a copy of one. That’s where Arkoosh’s tweet was mistaken. However, the process for a healthcare provider to take those steps is likely to require the involvement of the patient, and could well be traumatizing for her.  For example, Section 501 of the Vital Statistics Law states that, in the context of preparing and filing a fetal death certificate: The “person best acquainted with the facts” is likely, in many cases, to be the patient herself, meaning healthcare providers — in order to discharge their own legal obligations as best they can — are realistically obliged to consult the patient and discuss the fetal death with her. So while it’s not accurate to say women who have a miscarriage or abortion are “forced to fill out” a fetal death certificate application, as Arkoosh claimed, they are effectively forced to take part in the filling out of a fetal death certificate. For reasons we will outline, HB 118 could greatly increase the prevalence of that involuntary participation in completing fetal death certificates. Expansion of Obligations Importantly, the Vital Statistics Law defines “fetal death” as follows: Therefore, under existing Pennsylvania law, the certification and disposal requirements associated with a fetal death do not apply where the loss of pregnancy takes place before 16 weeks gestation. By contrast, HB 118, sponsored by State Rep. Francis Ryan, a Republican, removes that gestational age parameter from its definition of fetal death, as follows: By removing the 16-week threshold from the definition of fetal death, HB 118 appears to require healthcare providers to file a fetal death certificate for any and all fetal remains, no matter how early in the pregnancy. Most abortions take place early in pregnancies. In Pennsylvania in 2019, for example, almost 29,000 of the 31,000 abortions in the state that year (92%) happened before 14 weeks gestational age. Furthermore, it is estimated that around 80% of miscarriages take place within the first 12 weeks of a pregnancy (although some women undergo miscarriages at home rather than in a healthcare setting). For these reasons, it is fair to assume that HB 118 would, if implemented, quite significantly increase the administrative burdens on healthcare providers involved in pregnancy loss, in the state of Pennsylvania. Furthermore, given the fact that filing a fetal death certificate is likely to require discussion and consultation with patients, as outlined above, it is also reasonable to assume that HB 118 would, if implemented, significantly multiply the trauma inflicted upon women who undergo a miscarriage or abortion, and do not wish to take part in fetal death registration or related discussions. A measure of confusion exists over the wording of HB 118, and its consequences. HB 118 does not explicitly amend the existing definition of “fetal death” in the Vital Statistics Law, so it’s not clear which definition would take precedence — the existing one, which relates only to fetal deaths after 16 weeks gestational age, or the new one, which has no gestational age parameters and would expand the certification requirements from a minority of cases to all fetal deaths.  In a news release, Ryan’s office insisted that HB 118 “does not require a death certificate” and suggested that the 16-week rule stemmed from the federal U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as follows: This is inaccurate. The CDC does not require recording of fetal deaths after 16 weeks, and such recording requirements vary from state to state. It is particularly unusual that Ryan would attribute the 16-week rule to the CDC, when the definition of “fetal death” in his own legislation clearly appears to have been taken from the definition found in the Vital Statistics Law — the wording is almost identical, but with the phrase “after sixteen (16) weeks gestation” removed.  Snopes asked a spokesperson for Ryan about this, and asked whether he supported keeping the 16-week floor for fetal death certificates and disposal requirements, but we did not receive a response.   Given that Ryan’s definition of “fetal death” has almost the exact same wording as the one found in the Vital Statistics Law, the new definition appears to be an amendment of the old one, in all but name.  HB 118 would introduce a new requirement for healthcare providers to either bury or cremate fetal remains, no matter how early the pregnancy loss takes place, and no matter the cause. Under existing law, healthcare providers are obliged to obtain a disposal permit after 16 weeks gestational age, but there is no specific requirement for the manner in which a healthcare provider disposes of fetal remains (provided the disposal is otherwise lawful), and such remains are sometimes disposed of as medical waste.  Specific requirements do exist, in the context of abortions, for the examination and disposal of tissue extracted during first and second-trimester abortions.  HB 118 would change that. In Section 3(b), the bill lists the obligations it would place on “health care facilities.” Among them is “Cremate or inter the fetal remains.” Because HB 118 defines “fetal remains” as “the fetus expelled or extracted” in a fetal death, it would include cases of miscarriage. So Ryan’s bill would take Pennsylvania law from requiring certain protocols for the examination and disposal of tissue after abortions, including disposal as medical waste, to now requiring burial or cremation for all fetal remains, at any gestational age, no matter the cause. This burial/cremation requirement follows similar laws recently introduced in several other states, including Indiana, whose 2016 legislation was signed into law by then-Gov. Mike Pence. In 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana’s fetal remains law, after a challenge from Planned Parenthood and others.  Importantly, the burial/cremation rule in HB 118 would also appear to trigger a requirement to file a death certificate for all fetal remains. Here’s how: Thus, HB 118 creates an obligation to bury or cremate all fetal remains, no matter the gestational age or cause of death.  Therefore, HB 118 would appear to indirectly trigger a requirement for a fetal death certificate to be filed for every fetal death. So, if Ryan’s new, all-inclusive definition of “fetal death” is used or takes precedence, HB 118 would require a fetal death certificate for all fetal deaths in two ways: However, while the requirement to bury or cremate any and all fetal remains comes from HB 118, the requirement to file a death certificate in order to get a burial permit comes from the Vital Statistics Law and, as we have already outlined, that particular legislation defines “fetal death” as only including fetal deaths after 16 weeks gestation. So again we are faced with the discrepancy between the existing definition of “fetal death” and the new one proposed in HB 118.  Finally, HB 118 would also introduce new criminal penalties for healthcare providers. Section 4 of the bill states that:  Article IX of that law states, in turn, that: So, under HB 118, a healthcare provider who fails to properly certify a fetal death, or disposes of fetal remains in any way other than burial or cremation, could face fines of up to $300, and if they don’t pay those fines, they could in principle be sent to jail for up to one month. On May 25, members of the House Health Committee voted 15-10, along party lines, to pass HB 118 and report it for consideration by the entire General Assembly. The bill is opposed by various pro-choice groups including the ACLU, Women’s Law Project, and Planned Parenthood.","https://archive.is/b88Hj,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/05/Copy-of-Rating-Overlay-Vertical-25.png,https://archive.is/8j3zn,https://www.facebook.com/valarkooshpa/posts/133701898821948,https://www.instagram.com/p/CPTBwBdDRvC/,https://archive.is/gtkU6,https://web.archive.org/web/20210526021723/https://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/US/PDF/1953/0/0066..PDF,https://web.archive.org/web/20210526021723/https://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/US/PDF/1953/0/0066..PDF,https://web.archive.org/web/20210526035543/https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&sessYr=2021&sessInd=0&billBody=H&billTyp=B&billNbr=0118&pn=0086,https://web.archive.org/web/20210304001031/https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/HealthStatistics/VitalStatistics/Documents/Pennsylvania_Annual_Abortion_Report_2019.pdf,https://www.snopes.com/uploads/2021/05/ACOG-Practice-bulletin-early-pregnancy-loss-2015.pdf,https://archive.is/Dai4x,https://web.archive.org/web/20210319175728/https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr69/nvsr69-04-508.pdf,https://archive.is/Puz0T,https://archive.is/rWzCV,https://web.archive.org/web/20210526035543/https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&sessYr=2021&sessInd=0&billBody=H&billTyp=B&billNbr=0118&pn=0086,https://archive.is/0k0HF,https://web.archive.org/web/20210428120645/https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-483_3d9g.pdf,https://web.archive.org/web/20210526035543/https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&sessYr=2021&sessInd=0&billBody=H&billTyp=B&billNbr=0118&pn=0086,https://web.archive.org/web/20210526021723/https://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/US/PDF/1953/0/0066..PDF,https://archive.is/2bG6d,https://www.aclupa.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/aclu-pa_opposition_to_hb_118_pn_86_house_health_2021-05-21.pdf,https://archive.is/7p03q,https://archive.is/UjnlK",Did Pennsylvania Lawmakers Vote to Fine Women Who Have a Miscarriage?,Editor's Picks,,,,,

In a meme that has been shared by social media users since May 2021, the image is accompanied by a caption that reads, “This is what a blade of grass looks like under a microscope. Next time you take a walk outside, know that the grass is happy to see you.”  Although we were unable to find the original source of the above image, we did locate other microscopic images of grass with similar features. A discussion about the image cropped up in 2015 on the question-and-answer site StackExchange, where a user with an anonymous profile pointed to a similar image on a science stock photo website that was captioned: Maria Morrow, assistant professor of botany and environmental science at College of the Redwoods, pointed out that the “smiley faces” are in fact vascular bundles typical in plants called monocots — plants that are only composed of one leaf, like grass. So although the above image does depict the components of a real leaf cross section under a microscope, it’s safe to say that the image doesn’t in any literal sense show a leaf “smiling” or “happy to see you.” In fact, describing these characteristics as smiley faces is a subjective call. Looking at the image included in Morrow’s article, one could argue the leaf is actually screaming at you: In other words, the “smiley faces” are just an illusion created by viewing a slice of the leaf’s round vascular bundles from above, through a microscope lens.","https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-8.57.48-AM.png,https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/xerophytic-grass-microscope?phrase=xerophytic%20grass%20microscope&sort=best,https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Xerophytic_Leaf_Cross_Section_Stained_Microscope_Slide.jpg,https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27989/is-this-a-grass-cell/50568,https://web.archive.org/web/20160607235026/https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/30161/view,https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Botany/Book%3A_Botany_Lab_Manual_(Morrow)/08%3A_Shoot_Anatomy_and_Morphology/8.4%3A_Monocots,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Edvard_Munch%2C_1893%2C_The_Scream%2C_oil%2C_tempera_and_pastel_on_cardboard%2C_91_x_73_cm%2C_National_Gallery_of_Norway.jpg",Does Microscopic Image Show ‘Smiley Faces’ in a Blade of Grass?,,,,,,

13,,,,What's False,David Mikkelson,2013-05-28,,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/author/snopes/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/memorial-day/,Memorial Day began with a May 1865 ceremony held by former slaves to honor Union war dead.,2013-05-28,snopes,,"The custom of holding observances (including the laying of flowers on burial sites) to remember and honor those who gave their lives in military service goes back many hundreds, if not thousands, of years. In the United States, that custom has long since been formalized in the creation of Memorial Day (formerly known as Decoration Day), a federal holiday observed on the last Monday in May to remember the men and women who died while serving in the United States Armed Forces. Traditionally, every year the President of the United States (or, in his absence, another high-ranking government official) visits Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day to honor all those Americans who have died in military service to their country by participating in a symbolic wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns: In a formal sense, the modern Memorial Day originated with an order issued in 1868 by Maj. Gen. John A. Logan, the commander in chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, for the annual decoration of war graves: In a literal sense, it was not until 1971 that Memorial Day was established as a federal holiday by Congress. Regardless of when Decoration Day (or Memorial Day) may have been officially established, though, debate continues to this day regarding exactly when and where the first observance of this nature was held in the United States. In May 1966 the city of Waterloo, New York, was designated as the “Birthplace of Memorial Day” via a Congressional resolutions and presidential proclamation commemorating a patriotic observance held in that town one hundred years earlier: Nonetheless, dozens of other places still lay claim, based on a variety of criteria, to being the true birthplace of the modern Memorial Day, and more recent historical studies have concluded that all of those claims (including Waterloo’s) are apocryphal: The multiplicity of sites that have claimed Memorial Day birthplace status for themselves are not all in the North; many contenders are Southern cities that were part of the Confederacy during the Civil War: In his book Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory, Professor David W. Blight made the case for Charleston, South Carolina, as Memorial Day’s birthplace, as that city was the site of an obscure (possibly suppressed) May 1865 event held at a racetrack turned war prison, during which freedmen properly reburied hundreds of Union dead found there and then held a ceremony to dedicate the cemetery: Although contemporaneous accounts from the Charleston Daily Courier describe and document the 1865 ceremony that took place there, and the event was one the earliest known observances similar to what we would now recognize as Memorial Day, whether it was truly the first such ceremony, and what influence (if any) it might have had on later observances, are still matters of contention. Professor Blight termed it “the first Memorial Day” because it predated most of the other contenders, but he noted he has no evidence that it led to General Logan’s call for a national holiday in 1868: “I’m much more interested in the meaning that’s being conveyed in that incredible ritual than who’s first,” he said. In their 2014 book The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday, Dr. Richard Gardiner and Daniel Bellware concluded that credit for the origins of Memorial Day should likely rest with a group of women in Columbus, Georgia known as the Ladies Memorial Association, who beginning in 1866 held an annual observance originally called “Memorial Day,” then subsequently referred to as “Confederate Memorial Day” after (as referenced above) northerners co-opted the event in 1868 and established their own Memorial Day.","http://www.va.gov/opa/speceven/memday/history.asp,http://www.waterloony.com/mdayhistory.html,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=27618",The Origins of Memorial Day,"memorial day, slavery",,,,,

That core claim was accurate. The watermelon is designated, in law, as the official state vegetable of Oklahoma. We’re issuing a rating of “True.” That official designation came about in 2007. Two lawmakers — Democratic State Rep. Joe Dorman and Republican State Sen. Don Barrington — sponsored House Bill 1669, which proposed adding a new section to the Oklahoma statutes, declaring that “The watermelon is hereby designated and adopted as the official vegetable of the State of Oklahoma.” In March, the House passed the bill 78-19, and the Senate did likewise, in a 44-2 vote. On April 24, then-Gov. Brad Henry, a Democrat, signed the bill into law. As of May 2021, Sec. 25-98.15 of the Oklahoma Statutes states: “The watermelon is hereby designated and adopted as the official vegetable of the State of Oklahoma.” The move caused controversy at the time and attracted a measure of national and international news coverage. Dorman’s home town of Rush Springs describes itself as “The Watermelon Capital of the World” and hosts an annual watermelon festival, an indication that his push for the designation was not purely motivated by an interest in botany or agriculture. A poll of readers of The Oklahoman newspaper found that 89 percent did not consider the watermelon a vegetable.  Before HB 1669 was signed into law, a fiscal impact report addressed the dispute over how the watermelon should be classified, as follows: The watermelon, specifically Citrullus lanatus, the species cited in the fiscal impact report, is undoubtedly a fruit. In botany, a fruit is defined as the matured ovary of a plant, or its contents, and the watermelon fits that description.  The term “vegetable,” on the other hand, is not so precisely defined. It is often described as any edible portion of a plant — a wide net that would include fruits and nuts, for example — but some definitions specify that vegetables include only parts of a plant that are not fruits or nuts (for example leaves, roots, and flowers).  So depending on your interpretation, the watermelon is either exclusively a fruit, or both a fruit and vegetable — the latter interpretation being favored by Dorman and Barrington, back in 2007. For the record, the official state fruit of Oklahoma is the strawberry.  In 2015, Nathan Dahm, a Republican state senator, attempted to remove the watermelon as the official vegetable of Oklahoma. In February of that year, he introduced Senate Bill 329, which would have repealed the statute in question. However, the bill never advanced to a vote, and ultimately died on the vine, so to speak.","https://archive.is/5QalJ,https://www.facebook.com/search/photos/?q=%22official%20state%20vegetable%20is%20the%20watermelon%22&sde=AbqJcKhAQCSbrhkIuhHqLFQrzIte-8Wbx2JqPuEqECe9tR8a1XtEI327HmXs4vuPuuVvZyo2pjn7xOhWa8knXm_9PrIAuFFBxeBt0CexGi57jznGd1RKcr63vua9Y7w5mC4BYHrnZGXWFsr6ofwTunYulPGm9eA5sWWion-qft7HejJKhN7FGKK_SD5uSY6-6D5NwmK1ptqtKbarNJy4e9P81ByNhVM-V_7CGBELctVUMFpoLMSe400tR7Ky2sZ8yqQ,https://archive.is/LQ0jY,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-25-at-10.29.44.png,https://web.archive.org/web/20201030042406/http://www.oklegislature.gov/cf_pdf/2007-08%20FLR/hflr/HB1669%20hflr.pdf,https://archive.is/dSnO4,https://web.archive.org/web/20201018104601/https://oksenate.gov/sites/default/files/votes_documents/votes_2007/00765.pdf,https://archive.is/nkWeT,https://archive.is/DCL6O,https://archive.is/rmKWb,https://www.snopes.com/uploads/2021/05/The_Daily_Oklahoman_Fri__Apr_20__2007_.pdf,https://www.snopes.com/uploads/2021/05/HB1669-INT-FI.pdf,https://archive.is/zU78W,https://archive.is/DCL6O,https://archive.is/Yh1kG,https://web.archive.org/web/20160706222405/http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/cf_pdf/2015-16%20INT/SB/SB329%20INT.PDF",Is Watermelon Oklahoma’s Official State Vegetable?,,,,,,

In Australia, several natural-forming, brightly pink-hued lakes attract tourists from around the world every year hoping to take a peek at their out-of-this-world coloration.  And the lakes made their way around the world of the internet in late May 2021 when a user shared four photographs of the lakes to the travel Facebook group, Girls LOVE Travel.   “No way this is really that pink!” wrote Estrada. Screengrab/Facebook Yes, way. As it turns out, Australia is home to at least seven pink-hued lakes, some of which are found inland and others that are nestled against the white sand beaches of the South Pacific.    Perhaps best known is Lake Hilliar. First discovered in 1802 by navigator Matthew Flinders, the lake is located on Middle Island off of the coast of Western Australia. Like the other pink lakes of Australia, it is believed that Lake Hilliar’s vibrant pink color is the result of microalgae called Dunaliella salina. The salt-loving algae produce carotenoids — the same pigment found in carrots — that could help to explain how the lake gets its pink color. According to a 1987 study published in the Journal of Arid Environments, the water of some lakes can turn pink during the warm and dry months of the year when brine concentrations are highest. As water evaporates from the surface of the lake, and the body of water increases in salinity, D. salina develops its reddish pigment.  Researchers with the U.S.-based Extreme Microbiome Project, a scientific effort to characterize extremophiles and novel organisms, studied sediment and water samples from the lake to better understand the organisms that call it home.  “While the pink color is thought to be caused by salt-loving algae, the actual microbial composition of the lake is unknown,” wrote Ken McGrath, national sequencing manager at the Australian Research Facility. “The analysis revealed a surprising range of microbial diversity in the lake, and indicates that many algal, bacterial, and archaeal halophiles contribute to the persistent pigmentation of this pink paradise.” McGrath and his team genetically sequenced organisms found in the lake using what is known as metagenomics – the “fishing net” of genomics that captures everything in the sample, not just the fishing rod looking at a specific question.  A “bigger picture” of what was in the lake revealed that while D. salina is the dominant bacteria in the lake; other archaea — unicellular organisms like bacteria that make up a different branch of the tree of life — were also found in abundant numbers, including salt-loving species and subspecies. That same year, SciShow host Hank Green described this process as a special adaptation that allowed these microscopic organisms to survive in an otherwise inhospitable environment.   Though the exact mechanism behind Australia’s pink lakes is not completely known, scientists are beginning to understand how such hues can be found naturally on Earth.","https://www.australia.com/en-us/things-to-do/nature-and-national-parks/australias-pink-lakes.html,https://www.facebook.com/groups/GirlsLOVETravel/permalink/1835979343413047,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-28-at-3.49.49-PM.png,https://www.facebook.com/groups/GirlsLOVETravel/permalink/1835979343413047,https://hillierlake.com/,https://www.westernaustralia.com/en/plan_your_trip/travelstories/pages/the_amazing_pink_lakes_of_western_australia.aspx,https://www.algaebase.org/search/species/detail/?tc=accept&species_id=B883c0773f2bb66b7,https://phycocosm.jgi.doe.gov/Dunsal1/Dunsal1.home.html,https://nanoporetech.com/resource-centre/extreme-microbiome-project-xmp-presents-mystery-pink-lake,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140196318311790,http://extrememicrobiome.org/about/,https://nanoporetech.com/resource-centre/extreme-microbiome-project-xmp-presents-mystery-pink-lake,https://nanoporetech.com/resource-centre/extreme-microbiome-project-xmp-presents-mystery-pink-lake",Are the ‘Pink Lakes’ of Australia Real?,,,,,,

According to a Guardian report, this crackdown includes a ban on skinny jeans, among other fashion trends inspired by so-called “Western” culture. The Guardian report said this ban occurred after Rodong Sinmum, the official newspaper of the North Korean government, had published an article expressing concern about how young people are increasingly embracing Western fashion trends. “History teaches us a crucial lesson that a country can become vulnerable and eventually collapse like a damp wall regardless of its economic and defense power if we do not hold on to our own lifestyle,” the official newspaper said. “We must be wary of even the slightest sign of the capitalist lifestyle and fight to get rid of them.” According to South Korean broadcaster Yonhap news agency, in December 2020, North Korea toughened punishments for possession of videos made in South Korea. The report of the ban on skinny jeans appears to be sourced from Rodong Sinmum, though incidents of a crackdown on jeans and other fashion trends have been reported since mid-2020. Along with jeans, mullets, spiky and dyed hair are no longer authorized, according to documents published by the Socialist Patriotic Youth League, a youth organization under the control of the government, according to the Guardian story. In August 2020, the Daily NK—a paper based in Seoul that reports on North Korea through a network of North Korean informants—reported that North Korean authorities, including the provincial Youth League in South Pyongan province, were cracking down on “dyed hair, earrings, jeans and clothing with foreign lettering.” According to the report, authorities see wearing tight clothing as part of the “yellow wind of capitalism” and have labeled such conduct “anti-socialist behavior.” We have been unable to find the original North Korean source detailing the specific nationwide ban on skinny jeans, relying instead on the Guardian report, and older reporting from South Korean media. Like many things out of North Korea, such reports rely on second-hand sources. As such we rate this “Unproven.” We will update this rating if we receive pertinent information.","https://apnews.com/article/asia-pacific-donald-trump-socialism-business-health-9971ab0b93f3c7ebf1330d15500bd518,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/may/26/north-korea-bans-skinny-jeans,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/may/26/north-korea-bans-skinny-jeans,https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210513003400325?section=nk%2Fnk,https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210513003400325?section=nk%2Fnk,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/may/26/north-korea-bans-skinny-jeans,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/may/26/north-korea-bans-skinny-jeans,https://www.dailynk.com/english/south-pyongan-province-cracks-down-dyed-hair-other-improper-behavior/,https://www.dailynk.com/english/faq/",Did North Korea Ban Skinny Jeans as a Symbol of ‘Capitalistic Lifestyle’?,,,,,,

In many cases, the quotation was dated to 1945, including a widely shared 2013 post by the official USMC Facebook page:  Despite its prevalence, and despite what could be regarded as an official endorsement from the USMC itself, it remains uncertain whether Roosevelt ever actually wrote or spoke those words, and we found a few indicators that the attribution to the former first lady might well be erroneous. Until or unless definitive evidence becomes available, we are issuing a rating of “Unproven.” Snopes asked the USMC and the FDR Presidential Library and Museum to look into the provenance of the quote. Despite what appeared to be extensive research efforts, neither could locate the original source, or find evidence to support the attribution to Roosevelt.  Kirsten Carter, supervisory archivist at the FDR Library, told Snopes the quote was “out of character,” but could not necessarily be dismissed as something Roosevelt may have said: Furthermore, we found extensive evidence of the same quotation being used in reference to the U.S. Navy and American sailors. For example, in his 1996 memoir, former Naval Commander Edward Raymer wrote: The existence of this naval variant on the Roosevelt quote does not mean she never said it, or never said it about Marines, but it does raise the possibility of an old anonymous saying, popular among both sailors and Marines, later being attributed to a prominent public figure. And finally, we found definitive proof that the quotation existed before 1945. In October 1942, a group of Marine sergeants and corporals commissioned during World War II wrote a colorful letter to the editor of the Wisconsin State Journal. In it, they included the following observation:  Since most examples of the Roosevelt quote have been dated to 1945, and we know for sure she didn’t say it for the first time then, it does give cause to doubt the veracity of other aspects of that citation, including the attribution to Roosevelt.  Several possibilities exist. It could be that Roosevelt did come up with the phrase, first said it before 1942, and the 1945 date is the only inaccurate component of the citation that has become popular in recent years. Equally, Roosevelt may have used the saying in a speech or letter, but she didn’t invent it, and was simply repeating an already-popular quip about Marines, only for the quotation to be incorrectly attributed to her alone. Alternatively, it may have been a popular, humorous saying about Marines and or the Navy, which was later attributed to Roosevelt in order to lend credibility and prominence to it.  As of now, we don’t have enough evidence to reach a conclusion about which scenario is true. Until such time, our rating remains “Unproven.”","https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/eleanor-roosevelt-quote-liberal/,https://www.google.com/search?q=%22the+highest+morale,+and+the+lowest+morals+of+any+group%22&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS879US879&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=l5DJA4ObjnlScM%252CL24z_i7q3O3vlM%252C_&vet=1&usg=AI4_-kQjiXLzPFWnyUc5wDM6Fqjf3oZCVQ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiZ58OvuufwAhWeFFkFHSn-C1YQ9QF6BAgcEAE&biw=1680&bih=857#imgrc=l5DJA4ObjnlScM,https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Few_and_the_Proud_Marine_Corps_Drill/eR2SAAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22the+highest+morale,+and+the+lowest+morals+of+any+group%22&pg=PA253&printsec=frontcover,https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Boys_in_Blue_White_Dress/LQZQ0i9JSuoC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=cleanest+bodies,+dirtiest+minds&pg=PA204&printsec=frontcover,https://archive.is/V5Koc,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/05/Copy-of-Rating-Overlay-FEATURED-IMG-25-1.png,https://www.google.com/books/edition/Pearl_Harbor/ECcuDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22cleanest+bodies+and+the+dirtiest+minds%22&pg=PA1&printsec=frontcover,https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Pretty_Color_Ribbons_Of_War/24RiDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22cleanest+bodies+and+the+filthiest+minds%22&pg=PT83&printsec=frontcover,https://www.google.com/books/edition/Dragon_Boy/tYUfEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22cleanest+bodies+and+the+dirtiest+minds%22&pg=PT106&printsec=frontcover,https://www.google.com/books/edition/Descent_into_Darkness/2FZl9mg_Kb4C?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=cleanest+bodies,+dirtiest+minds&pg=PT22&printsec=frontcover,https://www.snopes.com/uploads/2021/05/Wisconsin_State_Journal_Tue__Oct_27__1942_.pdf,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/05/Wisconsin_State_Journal_Tue__Oct_27__1942_.jpg","Did Eleanor Roosevelt Say Marines Have ‘The Cleanest Bodies, the Filthiest Minds’?",,,,,,

Soon after his death, Twitter users shared a quote purportedly from an interview with Carle, claiming that he fought with his publisher against putting in a certain scene in his famous book “The Very Hungry Caterpillar.” The quote in question spread across the internet, and in it he reportedly said the scene involved the caterpillar getting a stomachache. Carle’s alleged reasoning:  Many pointed to the quote coming from a 2015 interview in literary magazine The Paris Review. But this item was not a factual recounting of real-life events. The article originated from a page that describes its output as being humorous or satirical in nature. The article was posted on April 1, 2015, as part of a parody issue called “Introducing The Paris Review for Young Readers.” As the “interview” gained traction, The Paris Review addressed it in a tweet:   The Paris Review also placed a disclaimer above the article in question: “This piece was published as part of an April Fool’s post in 2015, entitled “Introducing The Paris Review for Young Readers.” It is a fictional interview, and intended purely as a parody.

Maxine Waters had introduced a bill to rename the federal holiday to “George Floyd Day”:  Waters did not introduce any bills to rename Memorial Day.  This piece of text, which read: “Maxine Waters just introduced a bill to re-name Memorial Day George Floyd Day. Are you FRICK’N kidding me?” was repeated verbatim across a wide range of colorful backgrounds. No matter how many times this message was repeated, and no matter how vibrant of a background was used, this rumor remained utterly false.  A list of bills that have been introduced in Congress can be seen at Congress.gov. This government website also allows users to sort these bills by politicians. When we go to the page for Waters, we can see that the California politician has sponsored or co-sponsored a number of bills in 2021 — such as legislation that would “provide better care and outcomes for Americans living with Alzheimer’s disease” and “to allow Americans to earn paid sick time” — but Waters has not introduced legislation that would result in the renaming of Memorial Day.  Waters did co-sponsor the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021, but that bill had nothing to do with the annual federal holiday. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021, which would address “a wide range of policies and issues regarding policing practices and law enforcement accountability,” was passed by the House in March 2021, but has not yet received a vote in the U.S. Senate.","https://www.snopes.com/tag/george-floyd/,https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/05/maxine-waters-memorial-day-george-floyd-false.jpg,https://www.congress.gov/,https://www.congress.gov/member/maxine-waters/W000187?searchResultViewType=expanded,https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3354?s=1&r=1,https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2465?s=1&r=8,https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1280?s=3&r=29",Is Maxine Waters Changing ‘Memorial Day’ to ‘George Floyd Day’?,George Floyd,,,,,

Ted Cruz eating a fly.,2021-05-28,snopes,,"In May 2021, a video supposedly showing Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz swallowing a fly during an appearance on Fox News went viral on social media:  This is not a genuine video of the Texas politician eating a fly. This video was digitally edited to make it look as if there was a fly on Cruz’s face (and then in his mouth). In the original video, you’ll see no fly.  This clip comes from an appearance on the Fox News show “Hannity” on June 27, 2019, when the senator had to take a sip of water to clear his throat. While we don’t know why Cruz’s voice was hoarse at this moment, it wasn’t because he ate a fly. The original clip can be seen at around the 25-second mark of the following video: For one reason or another, the internet loves it when a fly lands on a politician. After a vice presidential debate in 2020, one of the most discussed topics was the fly that landed on the head of Mike Pence for nearly two minutes. The common house fly has managed to steal the political spotlight a few other times, as they have bothered President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and former President Donald Trump.  The “fly-on-a-politician’s-head” trope is so popular that some netizens have even taken to doctoring images and videos. In addition to the video above that supposedly showed Cruz eating a fly, a fake photo of a fly on the shoulder of Supreme Court Judge Amy Coney Barrett was circulated during her confirmation hearing.","https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-fly-lip-image/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rt5ghbGZ-Is,https://abc7news.com/donald-trump-hair-fly-lands-in-trumps/1356307/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/amy-coney-barrett-fly/",Did Ted Cruz Eat a Fly?,Sen.

The moon in the video is very large, and appears to be extremely close to earth, moving at an unnaturally fast speed across the sky.  The video went viral around the same time that many people in parts of the world saw the first total lunar eclipse in more than two years. At the same time, on May 26, 2021, the world encountered a Super Flower Blood Moon.  A “blood moon” occurs when the moon takes on a red hue as it aligns with the sun and Earth and passes fully into Earth’s shadow. The moon is also at its closest point in its orbit to the earth, making it appear larger and brighter than normal, earning it the title “super.” The first full moon in the month of May is also given the title “flower moon.” But the video in question appeared to defy all scientific explanation. A number of people shared the video with the same message attached, claiming that it was taking place “between Russia and Canada in the Arctic.”   A few red flags that told us this video is a fake: First, there is no reflection of the moon in the lake below it. Also, according to NASA, the closest the moon can approach the earth is an average distance of about 226,000 miles (363,300 kilometers), and realistically at this time the moon only appears slightly larger than it normally does.  The video makes the moon look like it is rolling unnaturally close to the earth, without the photographer zooming in, which is how most photographs or videos of this nature are taken.  The creator of this video appears to be TikTok user @aleksey__nz, whose account showcases CGI (computer generated imagery) celestial bodies placed over scenes on earth. One video even shows an exploding moon.    The user seems to be experimenting with CGI animation and creating fantastical scenarios, and the above video is one such scenario. Given that the video is clearly a creative exercise in CGI, we rate this claim as “False.”","https://www.facebook.com/groups/441227163449213/permalink/802269580678301/,https://www.npr.org/2021/05/26/1000452074/if-you-didnt-look-up-this-morning-heres-what-you-missed?utm_term=nprnews&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=npr,https://www.npr.org/2021/05/26/1000452074/if-you-didnt-look-up-this-morning-heres-what-you-missed?utm_term=nprnews&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=npr,https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/super-flower-blood-moon-what-it-means-and-will-chicago-residents-be-able-to-see-it/2518553/,https://www.facebook.com/groups/441227163449213/permalink/802269580678301/,https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/922/what-is-a-supermoon/#:~:text=Its%20closest%20point%20is%20the,where%20we%20get%20a%20%22supermoon,https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/922/what-is-a-supermoon/#:~:text=Its%20closest%20point%20is%20the,where%20we%20get%20a%20%22supermoon,https://www.tiktok.com/@aleksey__nz/video/6966459424219073798?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowyOhbkWUB6p3r7kpbQs8SCiJe0OgMXOJ8Kq10G7Vh75y9vfzJurSLjVesJB15a%2FalGgA%3D&language=en&preview_pb=0&sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAaNf63RNpxs-GTrxJuBbNHk3OnMFYfSWywGWurA4jDaQIbEfnOvTFuutEev2nIhAP&share_app_id=1233&share_item_id=6963129421117132038&share_link_id=AE321CA2-3765-4194-9EA2-F18A1DAA6E31&source=h5_m&timestamp=1622043979&tt_from=copy&u_code=d7khej9l9016eg&user_id=6725662259903235078&utm_campaign=client_share&utm_medium=ios&utm_source=copy&_r=1&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1",Does Video Show Giant Moon Blocking the Sun Over the Arctic?,,,,,,

Slate described the manner in which the social media network determines the order of content in any feed as “surprisingly inelegant, maddeningly mercurial, and stubbornly opaque.” The rumors followed on the heels of an 11 January 2018 Facebook blog post that addressed changes to the service related to changes in the content mixture that users could expect to see in their newsfeeds: However, these changes were described as affecting content generated by businesses and publishers, not individual friends and family members, and the only disclosures made about those changes were that they were intended to increase (not limit) interactions with friends and family: We contacted Facebook to ask whether the claim of limiting personal interactions had merit, and a representative told us that the rumor held no water (which is in keeping with our own observations).

28,,,,What's False,David Mikkelson,2013-05-28,,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/author/snopes/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/memorial-day/,Memorial Day began with a May 1865 ceremony held by former slaves to honor Union war dead.,2013-05-28,snopes,,"The custom of holding observances (including the laying of flowers on burial sites) to remember and honor those who gave their lives in military service goes back many hundreds, if not thousands, of years. In the United States, that custom has long since been formalized in the creation of Memorial Day (formerly known as Decoration Day), a federal holiday observed on the last Monday in May to remember the men and women who died while serving in the United States Armed Forces. Traditionally, every year the President of the United States (or, in his absence, another high-ranking government official) visits Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day to honor all those Americans who have died in military service to their country by participating in a symbolic wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns: In a formal sense, the modern Memorial Day originated with an order issued in 1868 by Maj. Gen. John A. Logan, the commander in chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, for the annual decoration of war graves: In a literal sense, it was not until 1971 that Memorial Day was established as a federal holiday by Congress. Regardless of when Decoration Day (or Memorial Day) may have been officially established, though, debate continues to this day regarding exactly when and where the first observance of this nature was held in the United States. In May 1966 the city of Waterloo, New York, was designated as the “Birthplace of Memorial Day” via a Congressional resolutions and presidential proclamation commemorating a patriotic observance held in that town one hundred years earlier: Nonetheless, dozens of other places still lay claim, based on a variety of criteria, to being the true birthplace of the modern Memorial Day, and more recent historical studies have concluded that all of those claims (including Waterloo’s) are apocryphal: The multiplicity of sites that have claimed Memorial Day birthplace status for themselves are not all in the North; many contenders are Southern cities that were part of the Confederacy during the Civil War: In his book Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory, Professor David W. Blight made the case for Charleston, South Carolina, as Memorial Day’s birthplace, as that city was the site of an obscure (possibly suppressed) May 1865 event held at a racetrack turned war prison, during which freedmen properly reburied hundreds of Union dead found there and then held a ceremony to dedicate the cemetery: Although contemporaneous accounts from the Charleston Daily Courier describe and document the 1865 ceremony that took place there, and the event was one the earliest known observances similar to what we would now recognize as Memorial Day, whether it was truly the first such ceremony, and what influence (if any) it might have had on later observances, are still matters of contention. Professor Blight termed it “the first Memorial Day” because it predated most of the other contenders, but he noted he has no evidence that it led to General Logan’s call for a national holiday in 1868: “I’m much more interested in the meaning that’s being conveyed in that incredible ritual than who’s first,” he said. In their 2014 book The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday, Dr. Richard Gardiner and Daniel Bellware concluded that credit for the origins of Memorial Day should likely rest with a group of women in Columbus, Georgia known as the Ladies Memorial Association, who beginning in 1866 held an annual observance originally called “Memorial Day,” then subsequently referred to as “Confederate Memorial Day” after (as referenced above) northerners co-opted the event in 1868 and established their own Memorial Day.","http://www.va.gov/opa/speceven/memday/history.asp,http://www.waterloony.com/mdayhistory.html,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=27618",The Origins of Memorial Day,"memorial day, slavery",,,,,

In March 2020, he posted on his Facebook page that the lyrics were “more of a coincidence than a prediction as I don’t feel I was ‘trying’ to predict anything, I just rapped about what I was watching.”  The story of a novel coronavirus was indeed reported on back in 2013 by numerous outlets including the World Health Organization (WHO).
