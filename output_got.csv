THANK YOU.” The 12 June 2021 post is on a Facebook page with some 14,000 followers. The photo and claim has also been widely shared on Twitter. In 2019, Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari signed into law that 12 June would be the national holiday of Democracy Day. The holiday is controversial. In 2021, Democracy Day saw protests in several Nigerian cities. The protests were against poor governance and “terrorism, criminal abductions and separatist movements”, according to one report.But what does the photo really show?#EndSARS ProtestsA Google reverse image search reveals that the photo has been online since at least 18 October 2020 – almost eight months before 12 June 2021. It appears in a 2020 article on the website of Premium Times, a credible Nigerian newspaper. The article’s headline is: “ANALYSIS: Will deployment of troops quell or escalate #EndSARS protests?” The photo is watermarked “Premium Times -- Kabiru Yusuf”.The photo is of #EndSARS protests in Nigeria, in October 2020. The protests demanded that the county’s police Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars) be disbanded because of the unit’s alleged extrajudicial killings, brutality and human rights abuses.Abuja, not NairobiWe searched the Premium Times news website and found articles by Kabiru Yusuf. Our fact-checking colleagues at Dubawa contacted Yusuf, who said the photo was taken in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital. So, no, the photo was not taken in Nairobi, Kenya, on 12 June 2021. It was taken in Abuja, Nigeria, in October 2020 during the county’s #EndSars protests.","https://web.facebook.com/genevievemmiliaku/posts/171519914983217,https://web.facebook.com/genevievemmiliaku/posts/171519914983217,https://twitter.com/_iAlen/status/1403697588935827459,https://twitter.com/chiefagbabiaka1/status/1403833196190605315,https://thenationonlineng.net/buhari-signs-june-12-democracy-day-bill-into-law/,https://theconversation.com/june-12-is-now-democracy-day-in-nigeria-why-it-matters-118572,https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-57418137,https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nation-is-fire-nigerian-lawmakers-demand-action-security-crisis-2021-04-27/,https://www.voanews.com/africa/nigerians-mark-annual-democracy-day-protests,https://africacheck.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/2021-07/Google%20Search-Nigeria%20Photo.pdf,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/421617-analysis-will-deployment-of-troops-quell-or-escalate-endsars-protests.html,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/421617-analysis-will-deployment-of-troops-quell-or-escalate-endsars-protests.html,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/421617-analysis-will-deployment-of-troops-quell-or-escalate-endsars-protests.html,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2021/02/nigeria-end-impunity-for-police-violence-by-sars-endsars/,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/author/kabiruyusuf,https://dubawa.org/endsars-photo-used-to-paint-narrative-kenyans-protest-in-solidarity-with-nigerians/","Nairobi demonstration in solidarity with Nigeria’s 2021 Democracy Day protests?

It also says the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) published a review of studies and found wearing a mask doesn’t stop the spread of Covid.In the video, a woman appears to be standing at a podium, talking to an audience off camera. She says: “Nearly 500 people were recently exposed to a Covid positive asymptomatic carrier. Zero got sick. Asymptomatic carriers of Covid do not spread disease.”She goes on to claim: “The CDC a couple weeks ago did a study where they looked at every single other study in the entire world on face mask wearing and this is what they found. The CDC found, quote, ‘no reduction in viral transmission with the use of face masks’.”The words “the information is there dont say u wernt warned” are printed on the video. It’s been shared more than 1,200 times so far, including in South Africa. Since Covid-19 was declared a pandemic in early 2020, the World Health Organization has warned that Covid patients who don’t show any symptoms of the disease can still spread it to others. It also says masks are a “key measure to suppress transmission and save lives”.Do studies prove that asymptomatic Covid-19 patients can’t spread the disease? And has a CDC analysis found that masks don’t reduce transmission?Video of US attorney Leigh DundasThe video does not identify the woman, where she is, or when the video was taken. It’s poor quality, taken from an original that doesn’t appear to be online anymore.But we did find a short video on Vimeo of a woman named Leigh Dundas, speaking on 13 April. Based on her voice, hairstyle, clothing and the background, it’s likely that the video on Facebook shows this woman, at the same event.In the Vimeo video she identifies herself as a human rights attorney. The video is captioned “Leigh Dundas, Board of Supervisors, April 13 2021”. Dundas, a US attorney, publicly supports that country’s anti-vaccination movement. Voice of OC reports that, in May, she helped organise residents in California’s Orange county to go to local Board of Education meetings to petition against mandatory vaccinations and “vaccine passports”.As Africa Check has found, there is no such thing as mandatory or “universal” vaccination in the US. And vaccine passports don’t exist there.Asymptomatic patients can transmit the virusIn the Facebook video, Dundas refers to a May 2020 study in Wuhan, China. It’s titled A study on infectivity of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers. The Covid-19 pandemic is thought to have started in Wuhan.The researchers studied 455 people who had been in contact with asymptomatic Covid-positive patients. None of the 455 tested positive for Covid-19. But the study didn’t find that people with asymptomatic Covid-19 can’t transmit the virus. Instead, it concluded that “the infectivity of some asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers might be weak”. SARS-CoV-2 is the formal name of the new coronavirus that causes Covid-19.Other studies of asymptomatic carriers have found that they can transmit the virus.A January 2021 study looked at 2,250 people in a “confined” community of university staff in the Canadian province of Quebec. Confinement, the study says, is “used to reflect social restrictions instructed by Quebec's government”.It found that 1.82% of the staff were asymptomatic carriers. None had contact with any known Covid patients. The researchers concluded: “Our results raise concerns about the possibility of viral spread through asymptomatic transmission.” But they added that the rate of asymptomatic transmission was unknown.In February 2021, a study based on daily mass screenings of some 20,000 residents of Luxembourg, a small country in Europe, was published. It found that, on average, asymptomatic patients infected the same number of people as patients with Covid-19 symptoms. The researchers concluded: “Asymptomatic carriers represent a significant risk for transmission.”CDC: Masks reduce Covid spreadAnd what about Dundas’s claim that a CDC analysis had found that masks didn’t reduce the amount of coronavirus transmitted between people?This is not what the CDC website says. A science brief on the site, updated on 7 May 2021, quotes several studies that found face masks reduced the risk of Covid-19 infection by as much as 79%, and had led to declines in daily new cases.The CDC concludes: “Experimental and epidemiological data support community masking to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2.” The CDC also says that making people wear masks can help prevent possible lockdowns in the future. The benefits increase when people are also required to use other measures against Covid: social distancing, hand washing and good ventilation. Conclusion: Video’s claims are falseIn a video posted on Facebook, US anti-vaccination advocate and lawyer Leigh Dundas claims that asymptomatic Covid-19 patients can’t transmit the virus. She also says a study by the US Centers for Disease Control found that masks don’t reduce the spread of the disease.But the CDC study doesn’t conclude that asymptomatic patients can’t transmit the virus. And  other studies have found that asymptomatic patients do transmit the virus. The CDC has published studies supporting the benefits of masks, and says wearing masks can reduce the spread of Covid-19.","https://www.facebook.com/zaayiin.yellodd/videos/vb.100066665882510/247084380557206/?type=2&theater,https://www.cdc.gov/,https://www.facebook.com/zaayiin.yellodd/videos/vb.100066665882510/247084380557206/?type=2&theater,https://www.facebook.com/zaayiin.yellodd/videos/vb.100066665882510/247084380557206/?type=2&theater,https://www.facebook.com/zaayiin.yellodd/videos/vb.100066665882510/247084380557206/?type=2&theater,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-is-it-transmitted,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-masks,https://vimeo.com/537203201,https://vimeo.com/537203201,https://vimeo.com/537203201,https://www.rawstory.com/leigh-dundas/,https://voiceofoc.org/2021/05/oc-supervisors-debate-cancelling-digital-coronavirus-vaccine-records-hundreds-of-people-rail-against-vaccine-passports/,https://voiceofoc.org/2021/05/oc-supervisors-debate-cancelling-digital-coronavirus-vaccine-records-hundreds-of-people-rail-against-vaccine-passports/,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Orange+County,+CA,+USA/@33.6394877,-118.3298942,9z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80dc925c54d5f7cf:0xdea6c3618ff0d607!8m2!3d33.7174708!4d-117.8311428,https://voiceofoc.org/2021/05/oc-supervisors-debate-cancelling-digital-coronavirus-vaccine-records-hundreds-of-people-rail-against-vaccine-passports/,https://africacheck.org/fact-checks/fbchecks/no-us-supreme-court-hasnt-ruled-against-universal-vaccination-theres-no-such,https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-afs:Content:10051817171,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wuhan,+Hubei,+China/@30.5684073,114.0201922,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x342eaef8dd85f26f:0x39c2c9ac6c582210!8m2!3d30.592849!4d114.305539,https://www.google.com/maps/place/China/@34.4504157,86.0458274,4z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31508e64e5c642c1:0x951daa7c349f366f!8m2!3d35.86166!4d104.195397,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219423/,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00502-4,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219423/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219423/,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655320307811,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Canada/@56,-96,3z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4b0d03d337cc6ad9:0x9968b72aa2438fa5!8m2!3d56.130366!4d-106.346771,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Quebec,+Canada/@53.4733017,-77.4028603,5z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4c58b5349fd1a8a1:0x1040cadae4d0020!8m2!3d52.9399159!4d-73.5491361,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655320307811,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655320307811,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(21)00033-8/fulltext,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Luxembourg/@49.8423357,1.6489564,6z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x479545b9ca212147:0x64db60f602d392ef!8m2!3d49.815273!4d6.129583,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(21)00033-8/fulltext,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(21)00033-8/fulltext,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/masking-science-sars-cov2.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/masking-science-sars-cov2.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/masking-science-sars-cov2.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/masking-science-sars-cov2.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/masking-science-sars-cov2.html","No, asymptomatic Covid patients can transmit the virus, and masks work",,,,,,

Yep its happening, time to unlesh the new TRUTH variant,” reads the caption of two photos of what seem to be mass protests, posted on Facebook in July 2021 and shared in South Africa.The first photo shows a huge crowd of people on an avenue in Paris, France’s capital city. The city’s famous Arc de Triomphe can be seen in the background. Many in the crowd are wearing yellow reflective vests.The second photo is of another crowd, flanked by police, in a city square. The flag of Greece can be seen waving in the crowd.The photos were also posted on an Australia-based Facebook page, with a similar caption: “Greece & France! Thousands rally against COVID-19 vaccinations and government restrictions.”But do the photos really show people “unleashing the TRUTH variant” in protests against Covid-19 measures in Greece and France?Protest against vaccinations in Greece, against fuel tax in FranceA Google reverse image search of the second photo reveals that it does indeed show a rally against Covid-19 vaccinations, in the Greek capital of Athens on 14 July.The photo appears in an article on M3 News, an international online news magazine.“More than 5,000 anti-vaccine protesters, some of them waving Greek flags and wooden crosses, rallied in Athens on Wednesday to oppose Greece’s coronavirus vaccinations program,” the article reads.It adds: “Protests are fairly common in Greece and there have been several in recent months on issues ranging from new labour law to the most recent Israeli military campaign on Gaza.”But a TinEye reverse image search of the first photo, filtered for the oldest version, reveals that it has been online since at least 4 December 2018 – over a year before the coronavirus was first identified in late December 2019.The photo can be found on the French-language stock photo website Divergence Images. A machine translation of its caption reads: “Demonstration of the Yellow Vests on the Champs-Elysees, Paris on November 24, 2018.” It was taken by Olivier Coret.According to the US National Public Radio website, the 2018 yellow vests protests in France were sparked by the announcement of a new environmental tax on fuel.“Nicknamed for the safety vests worn by protesters, known as gilets jaunes, the yellow vest movement has sparked a political crisis for the French government,” the NPR says.“The protests started in the French provinces but spread to Paris, where demonstrations turned into riots over the weekend and scenes of violent civil unrest played out along the city's famous Avenue des Champs Élysées.”The second photo does show a protest against Covid-19 vaccinations, in Greece, but the first photo is of a demonstration against a fuel tax in France, more than two and a half years ago.","https://www.facebook.com/sonia.bonacci/posts/10161008588853976,https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10161008566563976&set=pcb.10161008588853976,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Paris,+France/@48.8589507,2.2770201,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47e66e1f06e2b70f:0x40b82c3688c9460!8m2!3d48.856614!4d2.3522219,https://www.google.com/maps/place/France/@46.1389696,-2.4368094,6z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd54a02933785731:0x6bfd3f96c747d9f7!8m2!3d46.227638!4d2.213749,https://www.google.com/maps/@48.8741019,2.293728,3a,75y,111.88h,85.69t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ssbfllIbdqW_ylzUNmOcYbg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192,https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10161008571833976&set=pcb.10161008588853976,https://www.greeka.com/greece-history/flags/,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Greece/@38.0602976,19.99122,6z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x135b4ac711716c63:0x363a1775dc9a2d1d!8m2!3d39.074208!4d21.824312,https://www.facebook.com/hraaustralia/posts/290279962890655,https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10161008571833976&set=pcb.10161008588853976,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Athens,+Greece/@37.9908997,23.7033198,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x14a1bd1f067043f1:0x2736354576668ddd!8m2!3d37.9838096!4d23.7275388,https://mw3.news/in-greece-thousands-rally-against-covid-19-vaccinations/,https://mw3.news/contact/staff-directory/,https://mw3.news/in-greece-thousands-rally-against-covid-19-vaccinations/,https://africacheck.org/sites/default/files/media/images/2021-07/TinEye-Greece-protests.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10161008566563976&set=pcb.10161008588853976,http://www.divergence-images.com/olivier-coret/reportages/gilets-jaunes-champs-elysees-OCO1193/gilets-jaunes-champs-elysees-ref-OCO1193001.html,https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=http://www.divergence-images.com/olivier-coret/reportages/gilets-jaunes-champs-elysees-OCO1193/gilets-jaunes-champs-elysees-ref-OCO1193001.html,https://www.npr.org/2018/12/03/672862353/who-are-frances-yellow-vest-protesters-and-what-do-they-want,https://www.npr.org/2018/12/03/672862353/who-are-frances-yellow-vest-protesters-and-what-do-they-want,https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10161008566563976&set=pcb.10161008588853976",Photo of 2018 fuel tax protest in France – not demonstrators ‘unleashing truth variant’ against Covid measures,"fuel tax, protest, covid, Covid-19",,,,,

In addition, due to its diuretic properties, it reduces the volume of water in the body and therefore blood pressure,” reads part of the post.The post does include an unusual warning: “Be careful, even regular consumption of garlic does not exempt from appropriate treatment, especially in people with severe hypertension.” But is there any scientific evidence that the bulbous flowering plant can be used to manage high blood pressure? We checked.High blood pressure leads to 9.4 mn deaths annuallyAccording to the WHO, high blood pressure, also called hypertension, is when the force exerted by blood pushing against the walls of the arteries is higher than what is considered normal.“Hypertension is diagnosed if, when it is measured on two different days, the systolic blood pressure readings on both days are greater than 140 mmHg and/or the diastolic blood pressure readings on both days are greater than 90 mmHg,” says a WHO fact sheet on hypertension.Blood pressure is measured in units of millimeters of mercury, or mmHg. It is recorded as two numbers, the systolic or upper value first, followed by the diastolic or lower value. About 1.13 billion people around the world have high blood pressure, with the majority living in low- and middle-income countries. This leads to about 9.4 million deaths annually, says the WHO.‘Not approved by health authorities’ – expertSome studies have documented the potential of garlic in lowering high blood pressure in a similar way to standard medication. A review of trials involving garlic concludes that the vitamin B status of an individual is “an important factor for the responsiveness of high blood pressure to garlic”.But Basden Onwubere, a professor of medicine at the University of Nigeria in southeastern Nigeria, was sceptical. He told Africa Check: “Such prescriptions cannot be made by doctors.” “There are studies that have been published about the use of garlic in managing some health conditions but I am not aware of any traditional medicine that has been approved officially by Nafdac for use in managing high blood pressure,” he said.Nafdac is Nigeria’s National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, responsible for regulating and controlling drugs, among other substances.Onwubere said: “Until that [approval] becomes available, what we are using now is the orthodox way of managing hypertension. This is medication and advice on managing the patient’s diet.”Africa Check has also checked claims on Facebook that ginger or ginger tea can prevent heart attack and stroke, and that mixing lemon, ginger and garlic cures high blood pressure. Like this claim, we found no conclusive evidence to support these. Experts advise those with high or elevated blood pressure to ignore miracle cures promoted on social media and seek proper medical care.","https://www.facebook.com/Aduramigbaherbalremedy/posts/293950485769162?_rdc=2&_rdr,https://www.facebook.com/Aduramigbaherbalremedy/posts/293950485769162?_rdc=2&_rdr,https://web.facebook.com/Aduramigbaherbalremedy/posts/293950485769162?_rdc=3&_rdr,https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-300/garlic,https://www.who.int/,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/noncommunicable-diseases-hypertension,https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hypertension,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279251/,https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings,https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hypertension,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/noncommunicable-diseases-hypertension,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4266250/,https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/146/2/389S/4584698,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6966103/,https://www.unn.edu.ng/,https://www.nafdac.gov.ng/,https://africacheck.org/fact-checks/fbchecks/ginger-or-ginger-tea-wont-prevent-heart-attack-and-stroke,https://africacheck.org/fact-checks/fbchecks/no-lemon-ginger-and-garlic-wont-cure-high-blood-pressure","No, don’t use garlic to lower blood pressure","Garlic, high blood pressure",,,,,

Nigerians and there fake news flying upandan [up and down].” Biafra was a region that roughly correlates with Nigeria’s South East geopolitical zone today.  In May 1967, Biafra declared its independence from the rest of the country. A civil war followed, ending in January 1970 with Biafra’s defeat.  There are continued calls for Biafran independence, most notably by Ipob. But has Kanu, who has been living in London in the UK, been arrested?Kanu arrested and arraigned in courtThere have been multiple reports in the mainstream media of Kanu’s arrest, both in Nigeria and internationally.He was arrested on 27 June 2021 through joint efforts by Nigerian security agents and the International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol. But officials have not disclosed where and how.According to Nigeria's justice minister, Abubakar Malami, Kanu was brought back to Nigeria to face trial, after jumping bail in 2019.‘11-count charge’Kanu was previously arrested on 14 October 2015 on 11 charges, including terrorism, treasonable felony and managing an unlawful society. He was granted bail in 2017.He is also accused of inciting violence against the Nigerian state and institutions through TV, radio and online broadcasts, and of instigating violence, particularly in southeastern Nigeria.Kanu appeared before a federal high court in Abuja on 29 June 2021, two days after his arrest. While all the details are still to emerge at the time of writing, claims that he was not arrested are false.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=158238561912186&set=pcb.158238601912182&type=3&theater,https://web.facebook.com/groups/388050959313043/posts/466523654799106/?__cft__[0]=AZVbT-nA-yAjwpgsAhc1l4NBvq1ngxoQLVYc2lZNP4J9vZmrzX00uNUbEzMHp7Hn7b7MIcQCW7AdYYkwpsAkwqSPPAadikibVN_pfYbZa1WcKcJCrNNgPGqs9r42hcrlq-A&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R,https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/06/11/nigeria-biafra-kanu-reconciliation-independence/,https://web.facebook.com/groups/388050959313043/posts/466523654799106/?__cft__[0]=AZVbT-nA-yAjwpgsAhc1l4NBvq1ngxoQLVYc2lZNP4J9vZmrzX00uNUbEzMHp7Hn7b7MIcQCW7AdYYkwpsAkwqSPPAadikibVN_pfYbZa1WcKcJCrNNgPGqs9r42hcrlq-A&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R,https://www.britannica.com/place/Biafra,https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Map-of-Nigeria-and-its-geopolitical-zones-North-Central-Benue-FCT-Kogi-Kwara_fig1_256614605,https://www.britannica.com/place/Biafra,https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/06/11/nigeria-biafra-kanu-reconciliation-independence/,https://punchng.com/breaking-nnamdi-kanu-arrested-says-malami/,https://ugobestiky.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FB_IMG_15681388255829898-750x430.jpg,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/29/biafra-separatist-leader-arrested-and-extradited-to-nigeria,https://punchng.com/breaking-nnamdi-kanu-arrested-says-malami/,https://www.interpol.int/en,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/29/africa/nnamdi-kanu-arrested-nigeria-intl/index.html,https://punchng.com/breaking-nnamdi-kanu-arrested-says-malami/,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/470566-updated-nnamdi-kanu-re-arrested-returned-to-nigeria-malami.html,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/470566-updated-nnamdi-kanu-re-arrested-returned-to-nigeria-malami.html,https://guardian.ng/news/nnamdi-kanu-appears-in-court-after-re-arrest/",Biafran independence movement leader Nnamdi Kanu arrested – not ‘fake news’,,,,,,

This is not all the mining deaths in the world.There is a lack of reliable global statistics on mining fatalities. Deaths from mining diseases, and the deaths of contractors and small-scale miners, tend to be under-reported.“About 50% of global mining deaths occur in South Africa. Yet no single mining executive has been held accountable,” reads a tweet with more than 850 likes, which has been shared over 500 times on Twitter. The claim has also been posted on Facebook and other social media.When another user asked for “receipts” supporting the claim, the person who posted it said the data came from the International Council on Mining and Metals. Is the claim backed by data? We checked. Only 28 members included in rankingThe source of this claim is a 2020 report published by the International Council on Mining and Minerals (ICMM). The mining association collates the number of workplace accidents and fatalities recorded by its members.But the ICMM told Africa Check that its 28 member companies represent only about a third of the global mining industry. Not all mining companies are members and not all countries are represented. According to the report, South Africa recorded 22 out of 44 fatalities in 2020. This is 50% of deaths reported by its members – not 50% of global deaths. South Africa also accounted for more total working hours than any other individual country: 17.7% of all recorded hours in 2020.Government records more mining deathsSouth Africa has regularly fared worst in the ICMM’s safety reports. It has contributed the most deaths every year since 2015, the first year the council recorded location data. The one exception was 2019, when the Brumadinho dam disaster in Brazil claimed more than 250 lives.But the ICMM’s records likely don’t even represent all mining deaths in South Africa. The last year the country’s department of mineral resources and energy released a tally of mining fatalities was 2018. In that year, the department recorded 81 fatalities, while South African ICMM members recorded just 14.Data on global mining deaths is limited According to the Minerals Council South Africa (MCSA), another mining industry employers’ organisation, the ICMM’s 28 members “exclude huge numbers of mining businesses in many parts of the world, including some major mining jurisdictions, most notably China”.But determining the total number of mining fatalities around the world is not easy.“There is no one record of all industry fatalities,” the ICMM told Africa Check. “Individual companies will release their fatality numbers in their own sustainability and annual reports.”In 2019 the Wall Street Journal reported that many of the world’s mining fatalities may not even be counted. Its analysis of mining companies’ safety reports found that many did not record the deaths of contractors, workers transporting extracted minerals or deaths at joint mining ventures, which are managed by more than one company.The journal even found that more than half of the people who died in the 2019 Brumadinho dam disaster may not have been included in the official mining death toll. Deaths from mining diseases are even more likely to go unrecorded.Artisanal mining deaths may not be recordedAnother category of fatalities which may go overlooked is artisanal mining. In 2013, the World Bank estimated that there were “approximately 100 million artisanal miners globally”. This form of small-scale mining is often, but not always, conducted illegally. Deaths in this sector are more likely to go unrecorded. In June 2021 the bodies of 20 people believed to be illegal miners or “zama-zamas” were found near abandoned mine shafts in Johannesburg. In a 2016 report, human rights organisation Amnesty International said that in artisanal cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, “many accidents go unrecorded and bodies are left buried in the rubble”.And a 2004 publication by philanthropy organisation Oxfam, in collaboration with environmental non-profit Earthworks, found that “health and safety data for ASM [artisanal and small-scale mining] are sketchy, but the sector appears to experience a significantly higher accident rate than the industry as a whole”.Conclusion: South Africa accounts for 50% of mining deaths recorded by 28 companies in a single report – not 50% of global deaths. A widely shared social media post claims that South Africa accounted for “about 50% of global mining deaths”. But the report cited as evidence gives mining fatalities for 28 companies in 2020. That year South Africa accounted for half of the 44 recorded fatalities. The report likely doesn't even represent all mining deaths in South Africa. It also excludes major miners and mining countries such as China. We therefore rate the claim misleading. But data on global mining fatalities is fraught with problems. Beyond the lack of reliable global statistics, deaths from disease, and the deaths of contractors and small-scale miners, are regularly under-reported across the world. More and better data is needed to accurately determine how many deaths are due to mining, both globally and in South Africa.","https://africacheck.org/sites/default/files/media/images/2021-07/Screenshot_2021-06-21_at_16-00-47_T_on_Twitter.png,https://twitter.com/mokhathi/status/1406134773232418817,https://www.facebook.com/MduZondo/posts/4085206891534393,https://twitter.com/manhlamza/status/1406491787544432643,https://twitter.com/mokhathi/status/1406134773232418817,https://www.icmm.com/en-gb/research/health-safety/benchmarking-2020-safety-data,https://www.icmm.com/,https://www.icmm.com/en-gb/about-us,https://www.icmm.com/en-gb/about-us/our-members/member-companies,https://www.icmm.com/en-gb/research/health-safety/benchmarking-2019-safety-data,https://www.icmm.com/en-gb/research/health-safety/benchmarking-2018-safety-data,https://www.icmm.com/en-gb/research/health-safety/benchmarking-2015-safety-data,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243420300192,https://www.dmr.gov.za/,https://www.dmr.gov.za/Portals/0/Resources/Annual%20Reports/DMR_annual_report_2019_low%20res.pdf?ver=2019-11-05-161412-883#page=11,https://www.icmm.com/en-gb/research/health-safety/benchmarking-2018-safety-data,https://www.mineralscouncil.org.za/,https://www.wsj.com/,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-hidden-deaths-of-mining-11577825555,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-hidden-deaths-of-mining-11577825555,https://www.eiti.org/ASM,https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/extractiveindustries/brief/artisanal-and-small-scale-mining,https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2021-06-15-twenty-bodies-of-alleged-zama-zamas-found-outside-klerksdorp/,https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/this-is-what-we-die-for-human-rights-abuses-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-power-the-global-trade-in-cobalt/,https://www.amnestyusa.org/,https://www.earthworks.org/publications/dirty_metals/,https://www.oxfam.org/en,https://www.earthworks.org/,https://www.earthworks.org/cms/assets/uploads/archive/files/publications/DirtyMetals_Workers.pdf#page=2","No,  South Africa does not account for ‘50% of global mining deaths’","mining, global, deaths",,,,,

The protests were against poor governance and “terrorism, criminal abductions and separatist movements”, according to one report.But what does the photo really show?#EndSARS ProtestsA Google reverse image search reveals that the photo has been online since at least 18 October 2020 – almost eight months before 12 June 2021. It appears in a 2020 article on the website of Premium Times, a credible Nigerian newspaper. The article’s headline is: “ANALYSIS: Will deployment of troops quell or escalate #EndSARS protests?” The photo is watermarked “Premium Times -- Kabiru Yusuf”.The photo is of #EndSARS protests in Nigeria, in October 2020. The protests demanded that the county’s police Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars) be disbanded because of the unit’s alleged extrajudicial killings, brutality and human rights abuses.Abuja, not NairobiWe searched the Premium Times news website and found articles by Kabiru Yusuf.

It also says the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) published a review of studies and found wearing a mask doesn’t stop the spread of Covid.In the video, a woman appears to be standing at a podium, talking to an audience off camera. She says: “Nearly 500 people were recently exposed to a Covid positive asymptomatic carrier. Zero got sick. Asymptomatic carriers of Covid do not spread disease.”She goes on to claim: “The CDC a couple weeks ago did a study where they looked at every single other study in the entire world on face mask wearing and this is what they found. The CDC found, quote, ‘no reduction in viral transmission with the use of face masks’.”The words “the information is there dont say u wernt warned” are printed on the video. It’s been shared more than 1,200 times so far, including in South Africa. Since Covid-19 was declared a pandemic in early 2020, the World Health Organization has warned that Covid patients who don’t show any symptoms of the disease can still spread it to others. It also says masks are a “key measure to suppress transmission and save lives”.Do studies prove that asymptomatic Covid-19 patients can’t spread the disease? And has a CDC analysis found that masks don’t reduce transmission?Video of US attorney Leigh DundasThe video does not identify the woman, where she is, or when the video was taken. It’s poor quality, taken from an original that doesn’t appear to be online anymore.But we did find a short video on Vimeo of a woman named Leigh Dundas, speaking on 13 April. Based on her voice, hairstyle, clothing and the background, it’s likely that the video on Facebook shows this woman, at the same event.In the Vimeo video she identifies herself as a human rights attorney. The video is captioned “Leigh Dundas, Board of Supervisors, April 13 2021”. Dundas, a US attorney, publicly supports that country’s anti-vaccination movement. Voice of OC reports that, in May, she helped organise residents in California’s Orange county to go to local Board of Education meetings to petition against mandatory vaccinations and “vaccine passports”.As Africa Check has found, there is no such thing as mandatory or “universal” vaccination in the US. And vaccine passports don’t exist there.Asymptomatic patients can transmit the virusIn the Facebook video, Dundas refers to a May 2020 study in Wuhan, China. It’s titled A study on infectivity of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers. The Covid-19 pandemic is thought to have started in Wuhan.The researchers studied 455 people who had been in contact with asymptomatic Covid-positive patients. None of the 455 tested positive for Covid-19. But the study didn’t find that people with asymptomatic Covid-19 can’t transmit the virus. Instead, it concluded that “the infectivity of some asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers might be weak”. SARS-CoV-2 is the formal name of the new coronavirus that causes Covid-19.Other studies of asymptomatic carriers have found that they can transmit the virus.A January 2021 study looked at 2,250 people in a “confined” community of university staff in the Canadian province of Quebec. Confinement, the study says, is “used to reflect social restrictions instructed by Quebec's government”.It found that 1.82% of the staff were asymptomatic carriers. None had contact with any known Covid patients. The researchers concluded: “Our results raise concerns about the possibility of viral spread through asymptomatic transmission.” But they added that the rate of asymptomatic transmission was unknown.In February 2021, a study based on daily mass screenings of some 20,000 residents of Luxembourg, a small country in Europe, was published. It found that, on average, asymptomatic patients infected the same number of people as patients with Covid-19 symptoms. The researchers concluded: “Asymptomatic carriers represent a significant risk for transmission.”CDC: Masks reduce Covid spreadAnd what about Dundas’s claim that a CDC analysis had found that masks didn’t reduce the amount of coronavirus transmitted between people?This is not what the CDC website says. A science brief on the site, updated on 7 May 2021, quotes several studies that found face masks reduced the risk of Covid-19 infection by as much as 79%, and had led to declines in daily new cases.The CDC concludes: “Experimental and epidemiological data support community masking to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2.” The CDC also says that making people wear masks can help prevent possible lockdowns in the future. The benefits increase when people are also required to use other measures against Covid: social distancing, hand washing and good ventilation. Conclusion: Video’s claims are falseIn a video posted on Facebook, US anti-vaccination advocate and lawyer Leigh Dundas claims that asymptomatic Covid-19 patients can’t transmit the virus. She also says a study by the US Centers for Disease Control found that masks don’t reduce the spread of the disease.But the CDC study doesn’t conclude that asymptomatic patients can’t transmit the virus. And  other studies have found that asymptomatic patients do transmit the virus. The CDC has published studies supporting the benefits of masks, and says wearing masks can reduce the spread of Covid-19.","https://www.facebook.com/zaayiin.yellodd/videos/vb.100066665882510/247084380557206/?type=2&theater,https://www.cdc.gov/,https://www.facebook.com/zaayiin.yellodd/videos/vb.100066665882510/247084380557206/?type=2&theater,https://www.facebook.com/zaayiin.yellodd/videos/vb.100066665882510/247084380557206/?type=2&theater,https://www.facebook.com/zaayiin.yellodd/videos/vb.100066665882510/247084380557206/?type=2&theater,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-is-it-transmitted,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-masks,https://vimeo.com/537203201,https://vimeo.com/537203201,https://vimeo.com/537203201,https://www.rawstory.com/leigh-dundas/,https://voiceofoc.org/2021/05/oc-supervisors-debate-cancelling-digital-coronavirus-vaccine-records-hundreds-of-people-rail-against-vaccine-passports/,https://voiceofoc.org/2021/05/oc-supervisors-debate-cancelling-digital-coronavirus-vaccine-records-hundreds-of-people-rail-against-vaccine-passports/,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Orange+County,+CA,+USA/@33.6394877,-118.3298942,9z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80dc925c54d5f7cf:0xdea6c3618ff0d607!8m2!3d33.7174708!4d-117.8311428,https://voiceofoc.org/2021/05/oc-supervisors-debate-cancelling-digital-coronavirus-vaccine-records-hundreds-of-people-rail-against-vaccine-passports/,https://africacheck.org/fact-checks/fbchecks/no-us-supreme-court-hasnt-ruled-against-universal-vaccination-theres-no-such,https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-afs:Content:10051817171,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wuhan,+Hubei,+China/@30.5684073,114.0201922,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x342eaef8dd85f26f:0x39c2c9ac6c582210!8m2!3d30.592849!4d114.305539,https://www.google.com/maps/place/China/@34.4504157,86.0458274,4z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31508e64e5c642c1:0x951daa7c349f366f!8m2!3d35.86166!4d104.195397,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219423/,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00502-4,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219423/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219423/,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655320307811,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Canada/@56,-96,3z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4b0d03d337cc6ad9:0x9968b72aa2438fa5!8m2!3d56.130366!4d-106.346771,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Quebec,+Canada/@53.4733017,-77.4028603,5z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4c58b5349fd1a8a1:0x1040cadae4d0020!8m2!3d52.9399159!4d-73.5491361,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655320307811,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655320307811,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(21)00033-8/fulltext,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Luxembourg/@49.8423357,1.6489564,6z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x479545b9ca212147:0x64db60f602d392ef!8m2!3d49.815273!4d6.129583,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(21)00033-8/fulltext,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(21)00033-8/fulltext,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/masking-science-sars-cov2.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/masking-science-sars-cov2.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/masking-science-sars-cov2.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/masking-science-sars-cov2.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/masking-science-sars-cov2.html","No, asymptomatic Covid patients can transmit the virus, and masks work",,,,,,

Yep its happening, time to unlesh the new TRUTH variant,” reads the caption of two photos of what seem to be mass protests, posted on Facebook in July 2021 and shared in South Africa.The first photo shows a huge crowd of people on an avenue in Paris, France’s capital city. The city’s famous Arc de Triomphe can be seen in the background. Many in the crowd are wearing yellow reflective vests.The second photo is of another crowd, flanked by police, in a city square. The flag of Greece can be seen waving in the crowd.The photos were also posted on an Australia-based Facebook page, with a similar caption: “Greece & France! Thousands rally against COVID-19 vaccinations and government restrictions.”But do the photos really show people “unleashing the TRUTH variant” in protests against Covid-19 measures in Greece and France?Protest against vaccinations in Greece, against fuel tax in FranceA Google reverse image search of the second photo reveals that it does indeed show a rally against Covid-19 vaccinations, in the Greek capital of Athens on 14 July.The photo appears in an article on M3 News, an international online news magazine.“More than 5,000 anti-vaccine protesters, some of them waving Greek flags and wooden crosses, rallied in Athens on Wednesday to oppose Greece’s coronavirus vaccinations program,” the article reads.It adds: “Protests are fairly common in Greece and there have been several in recent months on issues ranging from new labour law to the most recent Israeli military campaign on Gaza.”But a TinEye reverse image search of the first photo, filtered for the oldest version, reveals that it has been online since at least 4 December 2018 – over a year before the coronavirus was first identified in late December 2019.The photo can be found on the French-language stock photo website Divergence Images. A machine translation of its caption reads: “Demonstration of the Yellow Vests on the Champs-Elysees, Paris on November 24, 2018.” It was taken by Olivier Coret.According to the US National Public Radio website, the 2018 yellow vests protests in France were sparked by the announcement of a new environmental tax on fuel.“Nicknamed for the safety vests worn by protesters, known as gilets jaunes, the yellow vest movement has sparked a political crisis for the French government,” the NPR says.“The protests started in the French provinces but spread to Paris, where demonstrations turned into riots over the weekend and scenes of violent civil unrest played out along the city's famous Avenue des Champs Élysées.”The second photo does show a protest against Covid-19 vaccinations, in Greece, but the first photo is of a demonstration against a fuel tax in France, more than two and a half years ago.","https://www.facebook.com/sonia.bonacci/posts/10161008588853976,https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10161008566563976&set=pcb.10161008588853976,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Paris,+France/@48.8589507,2.2770201,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47e66e1f06e2b70f:0x40b82c3688c9460!8m2!3d48.856614!4d2.3522219,https://www.google.com/maps/place/France/@46.1389696,-2.4368094,6z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd54a02933785731:0x6bfd3f96c747d9f7!8m2!3d46.227638!4d2.213749,https://www.google.com/maps/@48.8741019,2.293728,3a,75y,111.88h,85.69t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ssbfllIbdqW_ylzUNmOcYbg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192,https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10161008571833976&set=pcb.10161008588853976,https://www.greeka.com/greece-history/flags/,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Greece/@38.0602976,19.99122,6z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x135b4ac711716c63:0x363a1775dc9a2d1d!8m2!3d39.074208!4d21.824312,https://www.facebook.com/hraaustralia/posts/290279962890655,https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10161008571833976&set=pcb.10161008588853976,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Athens,+Greece/@37.9908997,23.7033198,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x14a1bd1f067043f1:0x2736354576668ddd!8m2!3d37.9838096!4d23.7275388,https://mw3.news/in-greece-thousands-rally-against-covid-19-vaccinations/,https://mw3.news/contact/staff-directory/,https://mw3.news/in-greece-thousands-rally-against-covid-19-vaccinations/,https://africacheck.org/sites/default/files/media/images/2021-07/TinEye-Greece-protests.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10161008566563976&set=pcb.10161008588853976,http://www.divergence-images.com/olivier-coret/reportages/gilets-jaunes-champs-elysees-OCO1193/gilets-jaunes-champs-elysees-ref-OCO1193001.html,https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=http://www.divergence-images.com/olivier-coret/reportages/gilets-jaunes-champs-elysees-OCO1193/gilets-jaunes-champs-elysees-ref-OCO1193001.html,https://www.npr.org/2018/12/03/672862353/who-are-frances-yellow-vest-protesters-and-what-do-they-want,https://www.npr.org/2018/12/03/672862353/who-are-frances-yellow-vest-protesters-and-what-do-they-want,https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10161008566563976&set=pcb.10161008588853976",Photo of 2018 fuel tax protest in France – not demonstrators ‘unleashing truth variant’ against Covid measures,"fuel tax, protest, covid, Covid-19",,,,,

In addition, due to its diuretic properties, it reduces the volume of water in the body and therefore blood pressure,” reads part of the post.The post does include an unusual warning: “Be careful, even regular consumption of garlic does not exempt from appropriate treatment, especially in people with severe hypertension.” But is there any scientific evidence that the bulbous flowering plant can be used to manage high blood pressure? We checked.High blood pressure leads to 9.4 mn deaths annuallyAccording to the WHO, high blood pressure, also called hypertension, is when the force exerted by blood pushing against the walls of the arteries is higher than what is considered normal.“Hypertension is diagnosed if, when it is measured on two different days, the systolic blood pressure readings on both days are greater than 140 mmHg and/or the diastolic blood pressure readings on both days are greater than 90 mmHg,” says a WHO fact sheet on hypertension.Blood pressure is measured in units of millimeters of mercury, or mmHg. It is recorded as two numbers, the systolic or upper value first, followed by the diastolic or lower value. About 1.13 billion people around the world have high blood pressure, with the majority living in low- and middle-income countries. This leads to about 9.4 million deaths annually, says the WHO.‘Not approved by health authorities’ – expertSome studies have documented the potential of garlic in lowering high blood pressure in a similar way to standard medication. A review of trials involving garlic concludes that the vitamin B status of an individual is “an important factor for the responsiveness of high blood pressure to garlic”.But Basden Onwubere, a professor of medicine at the University of Nigeria in southeastern Nigeria, was sceptical. He told Africa Check: “Such prescriptions cannot be made by doctors.” “There are studies that have been published about the use of garlic in managing some health conditions but I am not aware of any traditional medicine that has been approved officially by Nafdac for use in managing high blood pressure,” he said.Nafdac is Nigeria’s National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, responsible for regulating and controlling drugs, among other substances.Onwubere said: “Until that [approval] becomes available, what we are using now is the orthodox way of managing hypertension. This is medication and advice on managing the patient’s diet.”Africa Check has also checked claims on Facebook that ginger or ginger tea can prevent heart attack and stroke, and that mixing lemon, ginger and garlic cures high blood pressure. Like this claim, we found no conclusive evidence to support these. Experts advise those with high or elevated blood pressure to ignore miracle cures promoted on social media and seek proper medical care.","https://www.facebook.com/Aduramigbaherbalremedy/posts/293950485769162?_rdc=2&_rdr,https://www.facebook.com/Aduramigbaherbalremedy/posts/293950485769162?_rdc=2&_rdr,https://web.facebook.com/Aduramigbaherbalremedy/posts/293950485769162?_rdc=3&_rdr,https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-300/garlic,https://www.who.int/,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/noncommunicable-diseases-hypertension,https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hypertension,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279251/,https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings,https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hypertension,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/noncommunicable-diseases-hypertension,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4266250/,https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/146/2/389S/4584698,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6966103/,https://www.unn.edu.ng/,https://www.nafdac.gov.ng/,https://africacheck.org/fact-checks/fbchecks/ginger-or-ginger-tea-wont-prevent-heart-attack-and-stroke,https://africacheck.org/fact-checks/fbchecks/no-lemon-ginger-and-garlic-wont-cure-high-blood-pressure","No, don’t use garlic to lower blood pressure","Garlic, high blood pressure",,,,,

But officials have not disclosed where and how.According to Nigeria's justice minister, Abubakar Malami, Kanu was brought back to Nigeria to face trial, after jumping bail in 2019.‘11-count charge’Kanu was previously arrested on 14 October 2015 on 11 charges, including terrorism, treasonable felony and managing an unlawful society. He was granted bail in 2017.He is also accused of inciting violence against the Nigerian state and institutions through TV, radio and online broadcasts, and of instigating violence, particularly in southeastern Nigeria.Kanu appeared before a federal high court in Abuja on 29 June 2021, two days after his arrest. While all the details are still to emerge at the time of writing, claims that he was not arrested are false.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=158238561912186&set=pcb.158238601912182&type=3&theater,https://web.facebook.com/groups/388050959313043/posts/466523654799106/?__cft__[0]=AZVbT-nA-yAjwpgsAhc1l4NBvq1ngxoQLVYc2lZNP4J9vZmrzX00uNUbEzMHp7Hn7b7MIcQCW7AdYYkwpsAkwqSPPAadikibVN_pfYbZa1WcKcJCrNNgPGqs9r42hcrlq-A&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R,https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/06/11/nigeria-biafra-kanu-reconciliation-independence/,https://web.facebook.com/groups/388050959313043/posts/466523654799106/?__cft__[0]=AZVbT-nA-yAjwpgsAhc1l4NBvq1ngxoQLVYc2lZNP4J9vZmrzX00uNUbEzMHp7Hn7b7MIcQCW7AdYYkwpsAkwqSPPAadikibVN_pfYbZa1WcKcJCrNNgPGqs9r42hcrlq-A&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R,https://www.britannica.com/place/Biafra,https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Map-of-Nigeria-and-its-geopolitical-zones-North-Central-Benue-FCT-Kogi-Kwara_fig1_256614605,https://www.britannica.com/place/Biafra,https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/06/11/nigeria-biafra-kanu-reconciliation-independence/,https://punchng.com/breaking-nnamdi-kanu-arrested-says-malami/,https://ugobestiky.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FB_IMG_15681388255829898-750x430.jpg,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/29/biafra-separatist-leader-arrested-and-extradited-to-nigeria,https://punchng.com/breaking-nnamdi-kanu-arrested-says-malami/,https://www.interpol.int/en,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/29/africa/nnamdi-kanu-arrested-nigeria-intl/index.html,https://punchng.com/breaking-nnamdi-kanu-arrested-says-malami/,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/470566-updated-nnamdi-kanu-re-arrested-returned-to-nigeria-malami.html,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/470566-updated-nnamdi-kanu-re-arrested-returned-to-nigeria-malami.html,https://guardian.ng/news/nnamdi-kanu-appears-in-court-after-re-arrest/",Biafran independence movement leader Nnamdi Kanu arrested – not ‘fake news’,,,,,,

16,,,,Misleading,Keegan Leech,,,africacheck,https://africacheck.org/about/authors/keegan-leech,https://africacheck.org/fact-checks/reports/no-south-africa-does-not-account-50-global-mining-deaths,About 50% of global mining deaths occur in South Africa.,2021-07-28,africacheck,,"Messages posted on Twitter and Facebook claim that 50% of global mining deaths occur in South Africa.But the figure is taken from a 2020 report by the International Council on Mining and Minerals, which only records the deaths reported by its 28 member companies. This is not all the mining deaths in the world.There is a lack of reliable global statistics on mining fatalities. Deaths from mining diseases, and the deaths of contractors and small-scale miners, tend to be under-reported.“About 50% of global mining deaths occur in South Africa. Yet no single mining executive has been held accountable,” reads a tweet with more than 850 likes, which has been shared over 500 times on Twitter. The claim has also been posted on Facebook and other social media.When another user asked for “receipts” supporting the claim, the person who posted it said the data came from the International Council on Mining and Metals. Is the claim backed by data? We checked. Only 28 members included in rankingThe source of this claim is a 2020 report published by the International Council on Mining and Minerals (ICMM). The mining association collates the number of workplace accidents and fatalities recorded by its members.But the ICMM told Africa Check that its 28 member companies represent only about a third of the global mining industry. Not all mining companies are members and not all countries are represented. According to the report, South Africa recorded 22 out of 44 fatalities in 2020. This is 50% of deaths reported by its members – not 50% of global deaths. South Africa also accounted for more total working hours than any other individual country: 17.7% of all recorded hours in 2020.Government records more mining deathsSouth Africa has regularly fared worst in the ICMM’s safety reports. It has contributed the most deaths every year since 2015, the first year the council recorded location data. The one exception was 2019, when the Brumadinho dam disaster in Brazil claimed more than 250 lives.But the ICMM’s records likely don’t even represent all mining deaths in South Africa. The last year the country’s department of mineral resources and energy released a tally of mining fatalities was 2018. In that year, the department recorded 81 fatalities, while South African ICMM members recorded just 14.Data on global mining deaths is limited According to the Minerals Council South Africa (MCSA), another mining industry employers’ organisation, the ICMM’s 28 members “exclude huge numbers of mining businesses in many parts of the world, including some major mining jurisdictions, most notably China”.But determining the total number of mining fatalities around the world is not easy.“There is no one record of all industry fatalities,” the ICMM told Africa Check. “Individual companies will release their fatality numbers in their own sustainability and annual reports.”In 2019 the Wall Street Journal reported that many of the world’s mining fatalities may not even be counted. Its analysis of mining companies’ safety reports found that many did not record the deaths of contractors, workers transporting extracted minerals or deaths at joint mining ventures, which are managed by more than one company.The journal even found that more than half of the people who died in the 2019 Brumadinho dam disaster may not have been included in the official mining death toll. Deaths from mining diseases are even more likely to go unrecorded.Artisanal mining deaths may not be recordedAnother category of fatalities which may go overlooked is artisanal mining. In 2013, the World Bank estimated that there were “approximately 100 million artisanal miners globally”. This form of small-scale mining is often, but not always, conducted illegally. Deaths in this sector are more likely to go unrecorded. In June 2021 the bodies of 20 people believed to be illegal miners or “zama-zamas” were found near abandoned mine shafts in Johannesburg. In a 2016 report, human rights organisation Amnesty International said that in artisanal cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, “many accidents go unrecorded and bodies are left buried in the rubble”.And a 2004 publication by philanthropy organisation Oxfam, in collaboration with environmental non-profit Earthworks, found that “health and safety data for ASM [artisanal and small-scale mining] are sketchy, but the sector appears to experience a significantly higher accident rate than the industry as a whole”.Conclusion: South Africa accounts for 50% of mining deaths recorded by 28 companies in a single report – not 50% of global deaths. A widely shared social media post claims that South Africa accounted for “about 50% of global mining deaths”. But the report cited as evidence gives mining fatalities for 28 companies in 2020. That year South Africa accounted for half of the 44 recorded fatalities. The report likely doesn't even represent all mining deaths in South Africa. It also excludes major miners and mining countries such as China. We therefore rate the claim misleading. But data on global mining fatalities is fraught with problems. Beyond the lack of reliable global statistics, deaths from disease, and the deaths of contractors and small-scale miners, are regularly under-reported across the world. More and better data is needed to accurately determine how many deaths are due to mining, both globally and in South Africa.","https://africacheck.org/sites/default/files/media/images/2021-07/Screenshot_2021-06-21_at_16-00-47_T_on_Twitter.png,https://twitter.com/mokhathi/status/1406134773232418817,https://www.facebook.com/MduZondo/posts/4085206891534393,https://twitter.com/manhlamza/status/1406491787544432643,https://twitter.com/mokhathi/status/1406134773232418817,https://www.icmm.com/en-gb/research/health-safety/benchmarking-2020-safety-data,https://www.icmm.com/,https://www.icmm.com/en-gb/about-us,https://www.icmm.com/en-gb/about-us/our-members/member-companies,https://www.icmm.com/en-gb/research/health-safety/benchmarking-2019-safety-data,https://www.icmm.com/en-gb/research/health-safety/benchmarking-2018-safety-data,https://www.icmm.com/en-gb/research/health-safety/benchmarking-2015-safety-data,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243420300192,https://www.dmr.gov.za/,https://www.dmr.gov.za/Portals/0/Resources/Annual%20Reports/DMR_annual_report_2019_low%20res.pdf?ver=2019-11-05-161412-883#page=11,https://www.icmm.com/en-gb/research/health-safety/benchmarking-2018-safety-data,https://www.mineralscouncil.org.za/,https://www.wsj.com/,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-hidden-deaths-of-mining-11577825555,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-hidden-deaths-of-mining-11577825555,https://www.eiti.org/ASM,https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/extractiveindustries/brief/artisanal-and-small-scale-mining,https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2021-06-15-twenty-bodies-of-alleged-zama-zamas-found-outside-klerksdorp/,https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/this-is-what-we-die-for-human-rights-abuses-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-power-the-global-trade-in-cobalt/,https://www.amnestyusa.org/,https://www.earthworks.org/publications/dirty_metals/,https://www.oxfam.org/en,https://www.earthworks.org/,https://www.earthworks.org/cms/assets/uploads/archive/files/publications/DirtyMetals_Workers.pdf#page=2","No,  South Africa does not account for ‘50% of global mining deaths’","mining, global, deaths",,,,,

Focus on important and productive issues in the country. Every person has a right and freedom to express themselves.”The screenshot has been shared in two public Facebook groups, one with more than 280,000 members, the other with some 67,000 members. False claims of copyright infringement have been used in an attempt to silence @Kigogo2014, who has more than 577,000 followers and has been described in Tanzania as “our president of the Twitter republic”.The activist’s identity is unknown, a “closely guarded secret”, the BBC says. He or she told the BBC: “I'm a whistleblower and I expose corruption and human rights abuses in the country.”But did Suluhu, who succeeded Magufuli when he died in March, really tweet that @Kigogo2104 should be left alone?We checked.‘This information is not true’There is no reference to “Kigogo2014” on the Tanzanian presidency’s official Facebook page. An advanced Twitter search also returned no results. But the screenshot was posted on “Ikulu Mawasiliano”, the Facebook page of the president’s communication team – stamped “FAKE NEWS”.“TAARIFA HII SIYO YA KWELI. IPUUZWE,” the post reads. Translation: “This information is not true. Ignore it.” A screenshot of a tweet suggests that Tanzanian president Suluhu has called for activist Twitter user @Kigogo2014 to be left alone.

In many cases old or out of context videos were passed off as recent events. Social media users tagged Africa Check in many of the posts, including one with a video of a long queue winding along a road. Most posts of the video, filmed from a helicopter, said it showed food queues in Ulundi, KwaZulu-Natal. We checked. Google Maps confirms video filmed in Ulundi Using Google Maps we were able to confirm that the video was filmed in Ulundi. At the beginning of the video there’s a building on the corner of a T-junction. This is the Ulundi police station on King Zwelithini street. A billboard in the video is also visible in Google street view. At 19 seconds the Ulundi municipal building appears in the video. In Google satellite view, the same building and green roofs can be seen. Video filmed on 16 July 2021The next step was to confirm if the video was filmed after the violence and looting in KwaZulu-Natal. Africa Check spoke to Ulundi’s municipality speaker, councillor Johanna Manana. She confirmed that the video was shot on 16 July 2021, by municipal manager Nkosenye Zulu.  Manana said the queue formed because the municipality had decided that “only two shops, Spar and Boxer, would be open on that day. This was to try and avoid looting and burning of shops.” She said that all shops in Ulundi had since been opened.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/13/south-africa-zuma-protests-violence/,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-57650517,https://africacheck.org/fact-checks/reports/beware-you-share-these-shutdownsa-videos-are-misleading,https://twitter.com/SammyJoeD/status/1416056830661382147,https://twitter.com/SammyJoeD/status/1416056830661382147,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ulundi/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x1ef0636c86b220c3:0xcb1dd66c50c6974d?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiWiKnD5fjxAhX3QUEAHZW1AxsQ8gEwJHoECFMQAQ,https://www.google.com/maps/@-28.2951811,31.4291395,3a,75y,225.26h,83.33t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1svjOb6-wXxoZCsxqhwVg5XQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DvjOb6-wXxoZCsxqhwVg5XQ%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D304.48022%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656,https://www.google.com/maps/@-28.2954652,31.4281484,329m/data=!3m1!1e3,https://www.google.com/maps/@-28.2924603,31.4252623,329m/data=!3m1!1e3,https://www.ulundi.gov.za/office-mm","Yes, video shows massive queue for shops in Ulundi after #ShutdownSA protests",,,,,,

We checked.Debunked by South African government news agencyThe South African government news agency put out a statement about the reported phenomena on 11 June 2021, in response to the viral videos. It started: “The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health has welcomed input from top global health experts, who have dismissed purported links between the Covid-19 vaccine and magnetic fields.”Provincial government minister of health Nomagugu Simelane said that “several international medical scientists have rejected these claims as scientifically improbable and false”.“According to a report shared by World Health Organization (WHO) affiliated group, Africa Infodemic Response Alliance (Aira), Covid-19 vaccines do not contain magnetic microchips.”An earlier statement by the South African government on 9 June quoted Dr Stephen Schrantz, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Chicago. He said: “No, getting a Covid-19 vaccine cannot cause your arm to be magnetised. This is a hoax, plain and simple”.“There is absolutely no way that a vaccine can lead to the reaction shown in these videos posted to Instagram and YouTube. It is better explained by two-sided tape on the metal disc being applied to the skin, rather than a magnetic reaction,” he said.The government also quoted Dr Thomas Hope, vaccine researcher and professor of cell and developmental biology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in the US, who also debunked the claim.He said: “This is impossible. There’s nothing there [in the vaccine] that a magnet can interact with, it’s protein and lipids, salts, water and chemicals that maintain the pH. That’s basically it, so this is not possible.”Nothing magnetic in vaccine ingredients?In order for these metal objects to stick to where someone has received the vaccine jab, the ingredients would have to have a metal base.According to the WHO, none of the ingredients in Covid vaccines have a metal base.The WHO also says that many of the components used in vaccines “occur naturally in the body, in the environment, and in the foods we eat”. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also lists the ingredients for each of the Covid-19 vaccines approved around the world.The various ingredients in the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are listed by the FDA. None of these vaccines list any metal-based ingredients. The US Centres for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) notes that “Covid-19 vaccines do not contain ingredients that can produce an electromagnetic field at the site of your injection”. (Note: Only the Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer vaccines have been administered in South Africa at the time of writing.)Doses so small, even if were magnetic, wouldn’t attract objects shown in videosSome fact-checking organisations have also made the point that even if the vaccines did contain magnetic metals, one dose could not possibly cause a magnetic reaction. Medical professionals at the Meedan Health Desk have explained why: “The amount of metal that would need to be in a vaccine for it to attract a magnet is much more substantial than the amounts that could be present in a vaccine's small dose.”An expert the BBC spoke to gave some ways one can get metals to appear to stick to the skin. These include surface oils or tension and “trickery like band-aid residue or other sticky residue”. The claim that Covid-19 vaccines can cause a person to become magnetic at the vaccination site has been widely debunked by several other fact-checking organisations. It is simply not possible.","https://www.facebook.com/ruth.suowari/videos/418750162587520/,https://www.facebook.com/poemosis/videos/1168663400313236/,https://www.facebook.com/mbokazi/posts/10224841580205302,https://www.sanews.gov.za/south-africa/covid-19-vaccine-magnetic-fields-claims-dismissed,https://www.sanews.gov.za/south-africa/covid-19-vaccine-magnetic-fields-claims-dismissed,https://www.gov.za/speeches/mec-nomagugu-simelane-welcomes-dismissal-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-%E2%80%9Cmagnet%E2%80%9D-claims-hoax,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/vaccines-and-immunization-what-is-vaccination?topicsurvey=)&gclid=CjwKCAjwruSHBhAtEiwA_qCppkxj3NWUiMNQ3be39DV5yPfZ19F0O0YrB_Nqn0Zl4w7rsn2qR5939RoCvbEQAvD_BwE,https://www.fda.gov/,https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download#page=2,https://www.fda.gov/media/144638/download#page=2,https://www.fda.gov/media/146305/download#page=2,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-coronavirus-vaccine-idUSL2N2N41KA,https://health-desk.org/articles/what-do-we-know-about-the-pfizer-vaccine-and-magnets,https://www.bbc.com/news/av/57207134,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/06/21/fact-check-covid-19-vaccines-arent-magnetic/7698556002/,https://www.jacarandafm.com/shows/mornings-with-mack/watch-covid-19-vaccine-wont-make-you-magnetic/,https://www.bbc.com/news/av/57207134","No, Covid vaccines cannot make you magnetic as videos claim","magnet, Coronavirus, Covid-19 vaccine",,,,,

Cooperative governance minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma will, in terms of the disaster management act, “take over”.",2021-07-23,africacheck,,"After calls for a state of emergency to deal with protests and looting in South Africa, a message appeared on social media claiming that an emergency declaration would give the president’s powers to the military and put cooperative governance minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma in charge.Constitutional law experts told Africa Check this was false. A state of emergency would give the president more power, and he would retain control of the military.The current state of disaster to control Covid-19 does give the cooperative governance minister limited new powers. But she would not “take over”, as the message claims, under a state of emergency.A message heavily shared on WhatsApp and Facebook warns about the consequences of a state of emergency being declared in South Africa.“If a state of emergency is declared the military takes over the rule of the land and the state president is stripped of his powers,” it reads. “In terms of the Disaster management Act Nkosazana dlamini Zuma will take over giving power to the Zuma’s.” Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma is South Africa’s minister of cooperative governance and traditional affairs (Cogta). She was married to former president Jacob Zuma from 1993 to 1998.South Africa saw a week of violent protests and looting after Zuma was taken into custody to serve a 15-month sentence for contempt of court. At least 337 people were killed and 1,500 arrested. The violence led to calls for the government to declare a state of emergency to restore order.Is the message an accurate reflection of what would happen if a state of emergency was declared in South Africa? We checked. Viral message is ‘absurd’Prof Pierre de Vos, a constitutional law expert in the department of public law at the University of Cape Town, said the viral message was “absurd”. He explained that under a state of emergency, governance still lies with parliament and the executive. But the presidency is given more powers –  they are not “stripped” away. The South African constitution and the State of Emergency Act allow the president to declare a state of emergency only when “the life of the nation is threatened by war, invasion, general insurrection, disorder, natural disaster, or other public emergency”. It can apply to the whole country or a specific area. “It gives the president Cyril Ramaphosa more power to make regulations,” de Vos said. But he added that there were limits to the presidency’s additional powers under a state of emergency: “The extra powers can only be used if they are necessary to deal with the emergency. You cannot make regulations about things that are not directly linked to trying to deal with the emergency.”Michael Evans is an attorney and partner at law firm Webber Wentzel with experience in local government, and administrative and constitutional issues. He told Africa Check that the military would not take over during a state of emergency. “The president is still the one who [delegates] responsibility and [confers] power and he can at any time withdraw it.”State of disaster during Covid pandemic  The message also claims that “in terms of the Disaster management Act Nkosazana dlamini Zuma will take over giving power to the Zuma’s”. South Africa is currently under a state of disaster, which was declared on 15 March 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Disaster Management Act, which falls under Cogta, dictates which regulations are enforced. At the moment these include mandatory mask-wearing in public, a curfew, restrictions on gatherings and an alcohol ban.But De Vos said the act was “completely separate” legislation that could not override the constitution. Evans told Africa Check that while the state of disaster has given Dlamini-Zuma powers that she would not ordinarily have as Cogta minister, she does not take the place of the president. He said there were key differences between a state of emergency and a state of disaster.A state of emergency has more parliamentary oversight than a state of disaster. Under the constitution, parliament must review a state of emergency after 21 days. “One of the problems with the national disaster has been that once a national disaster has been declared there is very little parliamentary oversight, which we’ve seen in the last year and a half,” Evans explained. Another major difference is that the public still have all of their basic constitutional rights under a state of disaster. But these rights can be limited under a state of emergency.  No state of emergency since apartheid ended South Africa last saw a state of emergency under the apartheid regime, in 1986. Evans, who was detained three times during apartheid-era states of emergency, told Africa Check the current state of emergency act was a “much better situation”.“Under the apartheid era we had no constitution so there was absolutely no protection. You could detain people, for example, indefinitely under the emergency in the apartheid era,” he said. “Now, if we have a state of emergency it will be very different because you will still retain a number of your constitutional rights and some of the other issues are quite heavily regulated.”The constitution includes a section setting out which rights can be limited under a state of emergency, and to what extent. Importantly, the right to life and human dignity are entirely protected from limitation. But De Vos warned that a state of emergency should not be taken lightly, as other rights could be limited. “They could, for example, allow people to be detained for 30 or 60 days without a trial.” The government could have the power to limit the media and communication, such as by shutting down the internet, if it is deemed necessary to deal with the emergency.Conclusion: No accuracy in claims about state of emergency in South AfricaA viral message on WhatsApp and Facebook warns that a declaration of a state of emergency in South Africa would strip powers from the president and give them to the military. It also claims that under the Disaster Management Act, Cogta minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma would become president.Two constitutional law experts rubbished these claims. Under a state of emergency the president is given more power and retains control of the military. The current state of disaster to deal with Covid-19 does give Dlamini-Zuma more power than before. But she would not become the president under a state of emergency.We therefore rate the message as incorrect.The experts warned, however, that a state of emergency should not be taken lightly as it could allow basic rights to be limited.","https://africacheck.org/sites/default/files/media/images/2021-07/State%20of%20Emergency.png,https://www.facebook.com/bevlee.naidoo/posts/10159575876567498,https://www.dpme.gov.za/about/Pages/Minister-Nkosazana-Dlamini-Zuma.aspx,https://www.sahistory.org.za/people/nkosazana-clarice-dlamini-zuma,https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2021-07-17-this-is-us-those-trying-to-tear-south-africa-apart/,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/22/south-africa-unrest-death-toll-jumps-to-more-than-300,https://businesstech.co.za/news/business/505776/more-groups-call-for-state-of-emergency-in-south-africa/,http://www.publiclaw.uct.ac.za/pbl/staff/pdevos,http://www.publiclaw.uct.ac.za/,http://www.uct.ac.za/,https://www.gov.za/about-government/government-system/executive-authority-president-cabinet-and-deputy-ministers,https://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/constitution/saconstitution-web-eng.pdf,https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/201409/a64-97.pdf,https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/201409/a64-97.pdf#page=2,https://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/constitution/saconstitution-web-eng.pdf#page=20,https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/201409/a64-97.pdf#page=2,https://www.webberwentzel.com/Specialists/Pages/Michael-Evans.aspx,https://www.webberwentzel.com/Pages/default.aspx,http://declared,https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/202106/44772rg11299gon565.pdf,https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/202106/44772rg11299gon565.pdf#page=3,https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/202106/44772rg11299gon565.pdf#page=5,https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/202106/44772rg11299gon565.pdf#page=7,https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/202106/44772rg11299gon565.pdf#page=14,https://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/constitution/saconstitution-web-eng.pdf#page=20,https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/states-emergency-south-africa-1960s-and-1980s,https://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/constitution/saconstitution-web-eng.pdf#page=22,https://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/constitution/saconstitution-web-eng.pdf#page=22",State of emergency would NOT strip Ramaphosa’s powers and make Dlamini-Zuma president,"state of emergency, president, Dlamini-Zuma",,,,,

She has been acting governor since January 2021. The quote reads: “Without Francis Atwoli I wouldn't be deputy governor of Nairobi today, it is him who called Murathe and told him that regardless of being a Sonko nominee he believed that I would deliver. It is great honor to rename Dik Dik Road after my political godfather. On top of that he is also a staunch supporter of BBI.” Atwoli is the general secretary of Kenya’s Central Organization of Trade Unions. A road in Nairobi was named after him in May and he publicly thanked Mwenda for the honour on Twitter. But the renaming was criticised by some Kenyans and new road signs have been vandalised at least twice.David Murathe is the vice-chairperson of the country’s ruling party, Jubilee. Mike Mbuvi Sonko is the former governor of Nairobi county who was removed from office in December 2020.The graphic also shows the logo of the trusted news outlet Nation Africa. It has been shared by other users and Facebook groups. But is the quote genuine?No evidence Mwenda said anything similarThe graphic looks badly photoshopped and the photo of Mwenda is blurry. The quote includes misspellings and missing words, which is unusual in a communication from a trustworthy news organisation. The font is also different from the one used in other similar graphics from Nation Africa. These are all signs that the graphic wasn’t issued by the news outlet and is fake.Africa Check looked at all similar graphics published since 18 June 2021 and did not find this quote from Mwenda, or anything similar.Using the Nairobi City County website, we found the county’s Twitter handle and from there, the county deputy boss’s account. She has not posted anything on Twitter like the comment in the digitally manipulated graphic.We could find no coverage in any news outlet of a quote like it. It appears to have been made up.","https://www.facebook.com/groups/kenyapolitforum/permalink/2871879856444117/,https://citizentv.co.ke/news/who-is-anne-kananu-mwenda-the-new-nairobi-deputy-governor-311181/,https://citizentv.co.ke/news/who-is-anne-kananu-mwenda-the-new-nairobi-deputy-governor-311181/,https://www.pulselive.co.ke/news/local/jubilee-partys-message-to-anne-kananu-mwenda-after-taking-over-as-acting-nairobi/3h5jgg2,https://www.facebook.com/khalifoi/posts/10220970494184595,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/profiles/francis-atwoli-straight-shooter-no-hostages-over-street-name-3425646,https://cotu-kenya.org/,https://twitter.com/AtwoliDza/status/1397894774787616775,https://twitter.com/AtwoliDza/status/1397894774787616775,https://citizentv.co.ke/news/francis-atwoli-road-sign-in-kileleshwa-burnt-down-11932708/,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/entertainment/nainotepad/2001308336/david-murathe-the-chief-chef-in-uhurus-kitchen-cabinet,https://twitter.com/MikeSonko,https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/politics/article/2001397657/its-over-for-sonko,https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=192229306150952&id=103041941736356,https://nation.africa/kenya,https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=10219545116081750&set=bc.Abo0ISOgdBjLRJsp5pZmVgWquSoilJF5aqwBgAh8vVrEwN6TqiPjZQmE-ieYH54Qsbc8zq3CR5XoONVicDSSrcjsNQMG9SGmp22TEEPxc5YU87w4Kcgzj8O3cQu35AhVdh2jYpVYM5YZUrD5Xlj-4bLrS_0nyHsgsQlo5jhq7Nb9BeGCEJ99jqXLUA3xttjWpSaxrRgfYTnha_vinzbp2fH0NH5gHPMIY4AnrX5QTJRIs94YTuKrVoyjyieDkD7JLoCDQFYAy3kalnCn2FkIgMa9qJwsF6WIW75tjzqsJHa48dS-xYvBuD--uGqcvaZ7V18rjVpVRwRM1Uepy0eJVXXkDtYBCHv4eS9XGFB6YEDWdnCzSXtNDfcRV6m0qFjePuM&opaqueCursor=AbpySrKdzkXnOLaMMmf8XWMhrGtdJs2NotEy4bPwnkorwa91N9RlmWY5Ubav8iriaBEkfXTMJNp_IMTLmOPXgKbf7l9XB-xjAVzdNo0pc04VMN_qpGT2EiwchadFQJ0IDe55-qWUjvVjbtOkuA92RnmM2UYhyWb4v_u-c3NztQ3KVuiLE_hUtA6j3aXTEp3EfG9HuzZm7KI7ZnN1gLvOzJhY_K1w3X20sVWyiBeEpctqVRR1X412c-iCOxkyuaWPl2X0gcCp8jEUjTt4LbYa7d22IUu0N41GVUQCexpklQoIk_SSzs35Cy8qB7udXRemIJlM_5JwSIa2RvY0s1uDLxAgzU6tXaEAvIqAKhUJM4H53coGmr2gZhV1MuZNLhE7JZAPwnQUQsxD9ZSWFFpbAFtzmAk1Ht5xF3K4_SsPc82hxWIiaMyw0PNt_zT7gQwPVMCWoktJROLNOqGOmgymN6hSAzLcqmKGdVS3tYD7ejFBhIYJ5A58Ux3tjj2L8csU2Sj6k9GhOj_5puB6kACTewy1qohzEyMYrEXAYM5dizx__oC96hf5YULjHQqf0T2FYGY,https://www.facebook.com/khalifoi/posts/10220970494184595,https://www.facebook.com/groups/3061760543907386/permalink/4226008697482559,https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=192229306150952&id=103041941736356,https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=192229306150952&id=103041941736356,https://www.facebook.com/nation/photos/10159823771319497,https://nairobi.go.ke/,https://twitter.com/047County?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Eembeddedtimeline%7Ctwterm%5Eprofile%3A047County%7Ctwgr%5EeyJ0ZndfZXhwZXJpbWVudHNfY29va2llX2V4cGlyYXRpb24iOnsiYnVja2V0IjoxMjA5NjAwLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X2hvcml6b25fdHdlZXRfZW1iZWRfOTU1NSI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJodGUiLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X3R3ZWV0X2VtYmVkX2NsaWNrYWJpbGl0eV8xMjEwMiI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJjb250cm9sIiwidmVyc2lvbiI6bnVsbH19&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnairobi.go.ke%2F,https://twitter.com/047County/status/1405170397369282562,https://twitter.com/AnnKMwenda1,https://twitter.com/AnnKMwenda1",No evidence Nairobi county deputy governor made statement about Kenya trade unionist helping her get top job,,,,,,
