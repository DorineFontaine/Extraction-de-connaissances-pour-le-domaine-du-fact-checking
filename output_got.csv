He first claims: “You don’t need masks, they don’t work.” Masks do work. Masks have been shown in various studies to reduce the transmission of viral particles. It may be the case that respirators work better than surgical masks, but surgical masks are still beneficial. There is a reason why they are used and have been used for decades in healthcare settings.  Mr Yeadon then says: “Forget lockdowns, they never slow transmission which took place mostly in institutions like hospitals and care homes.” The effect of lockdowns on reducing transmission has been covered by various scientific papers. Theoretically, you would expect lockdowns, which limit the interaction of humans, to slow the spread of a disease which is spread by person-to-person contact.  Circumstantial evidence also points to this conclusion. In England, there have been three lockdowns, in March 2020, in November 2020 and in January 2021.

Multiple stages of trials have proved that these three vaccines are safe and effective. Although a possible link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and an incredibly rare kind of blood clot is still being investigated, the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risks for most people.  The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines both use mRNA “gene” technology which, once inside the body, provides the instructions on how to produce spike proteins like those found on the surface of the Covid-19 virus, prompting the body to generate antibodies.

2,,,,Other,Grace Rahman,2021-04-23,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/health/32-vaccinated-hospital/,Only 32 vaccinated people have been hospitalised with Covid.,2021-04-23,fullfact,,"An article in the Telegraph has claimed that only 32 vaccinated people were hospitalised with Covid-19 in recent months. It also said that “of 74,405 Covid-19 cases admitted to hospitals between September and March, just 32 had received a vaccine at least three weeks before.” This paints a misleading picture of what exactly has happened with vaccinated people getting hospitalised for Covid-19. Researchers looked at a number of hospital admissions in the UK during the second wave, 74,405 to be exact, between September 2020 and March 2021. From 8 December 2020, the date the first people were vaccinated in the UK outside of trials, 42,788 were admitted. Of those, 1,802 had been vaccinated.  The vaccine doesn’t offer protection from Covid-19 immediately after having it. Regardless of the particular vaccine you get, immunity from just one dose is thought to peak between three and four weeks after the injection. The researchers worked out how many of the 1,802 vaccinated hospitalised people had received the vaccine three or more weeks before. According to one of the researchers involved, Professor Calum Semple, who spoke to the Today programme, that number was 32. But it’s not correct to look at that 32 as a proportion of the total 74,405 patients in the study (as the Telegraph did) to show how effective the vaccine seems to be at stopping hospitalisations for Covid. That’s because the 74,405 figure includes people who were hospitalised in the months before the vaccine roll-out even began, as well as those who had been vaccinated, but caught Covid-19 before the vaccine had a chance to build up immunity (three weeks after they got it). Dividing 32 by 74,000 to get “one case per 2,300 patients”, as the Telegraph has done, is misleading. We could calculate a different figure: the percentage of theoretically fully immunised people who did end up in hospital with Covid. To do that we’d divide 32 by 1,802, which is 1.8%. That is still a pretty good sign that the vaccine is working. The Telegraph also claimed that this showed the vaccines “offered protection far above the levels which had been anticipated”. It’s true that these findings show that the vaccine works and works well, but not beyond the realms of possibility considering other sources of data which used different methodologies. The research described by the Telegraph wasn’t published in a journal and peer-reviewed as normal studies are—it is part of rapidly produced evidence by academics from multiple universities presented to SAGE, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. It was presented to SAGE on 11 March.","https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/20/exclusive-just-32-people-hospital-covid-vaccination/?utm_content=telegraph&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=Echobox&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1618951148,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/973183/S1143_Hospitalised_vaccinated_patients_during_the_second_wave__2_.pdf,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/health-55153325,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/?utm_campaign=coronavirus_grants&utm_medium=paid_searchl&utm_source=google&utm_content=keyword&gclid=CjwKCAjwmv-DBhAMEiwA7xYrdyXKsALttU1WrzhMgsKuQ8-vpzb8E0czKnT9lrhSQgTnoZsGPcq6kBoCe-gQAvD_BwE,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000v8w6,https://publichealthscotland.scot/news/2021/february/vaccine-linked-to-reduction-in-risk-of-covid-19-admissions-to-hospitals/,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/971017/SP_PH__VE_report_20210317_CC_JLB.pdf#page=8,https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2021/02/23/covid-19-analysing-first-vaccine-effectiveness-in-the-uk/,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/isaric4c-hospitalised-vaccinated-patients-during-the-second-wave-11-march-2021,https://fullfact.org/health/lateral-flow/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/puppies-canine-coronavirus/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/express-covid-risk-pregnancy/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-vaccine-shedding-side-effects-unvaccinated/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-19-vaccines/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",There’s more to the claim only 32 vaccinated people were hospitalised with Covid-19,,,,,,

The rollout of vaccine certificates has not been legislated or mandated by the government and plans are still under discussion. As has been widely reported, there is disagreement about whether the government should introduce Covid certificates. Many MPs say they plan to oppose any vaccine certificate scheme.  In the video, Mr Bloom said: “This is not a traditional vaccine, this is experimental and as I say big pharma have been quite upfront about the fact that it is experimental”.  We have repeatedly debunked a number of claims that Covid-19 vaccines are experimental.  The three Covid vaccines currently approved for emergency use in the UK have demonstrably shown high levels of protection against infection, and the expected benefits of the vaccines are said to “far outweigh any currently known side effects.”  Some of the vaccines used in the UK are mRNA vaccines. The technology behind mRNA vaccines has been developed over a number of years. Both mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would. We’ve said this before but it bears repeating: it’s normal that authorities continue to monitor the safety of these vaccines even after they have been approved. This monitoring happens with all vaccines, including those that have been in use for years, to detect any adverse effects. Just because studies into these vaccines are continuing, it doesn’t mean the vaccines are experimental. Mr Bloom also said: “...there are virologists and immunologists who are saying that it isn’t now that is the problem, it is (in the) years to come when you have interfered with your own immune system and your DNA.” As we have said a number of times, vaccines do not interfere with your DNA. Some of the Covid-19 vaccines are RNA vaccines; these contain messenger RNA (mRNA) which codes for a protein specific to the pathogen’s surface. The body uses this mRNA to build its own copies of these proteins which the immune system responds to by producing antibodies providing protection if the person catches the real disease later. Fundamentally, however, it does not change the DNA of human cells. In the video, Mr Bloom said: “...it could be that if your immune system is degraded in a few years time, the fact that you have had this jab may be a complete reversal. It may be then that you can't fly, you can't go into concerts, you can’t go into the pub because it's gone full circle and now what was maybe good for you today is not good for you then.” Government advice states that immunosuppressed adults “may not respond as well to the Covid-19 vaccine as others” and there is ongoing research to establish the safety of the vaccine among people with existing immunosuppressed health conditions. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Covid-19 vaccines weaken or “degrade” healthy immune systems.   We spoke to the Science Media Centre who asked experts what they thought of this claim. Dr Peter English, a retired consultant in Communicable Disease Control, and former Editor of Vaccines in Practice Magazine said: “As a vaccinologist, I cannot see how this relates to anything that science tells us. “I can see no reason to claim that current Covid-19 vaccines - all of which seem to induce vigorous cellular immunity, as well as an antibody response - are likely to impair future immunity in any way.” Professor Charles Bangham FRS FMedSci, Chair of Immunology, Imperial College London, added: “While some infectious agents such as HIV can indeed weaken the immune system, there is no evidence that the making of an immune response itself – whether to a vaccine, a pathogen or a toxin - weakens the immune system.   “The immune system has evolved to be remarkably powerful and flexible, so that it can combat pathogens and toxins that we have never encountered before, and it does not lose this potential as a result of making a response.   “Indeed this is in large measure how our ancestors survived, and why we are here now.  Vaccines themselves are extremely unlikely to weaken the immune system, and the benefit they have given to both humans and animals has been – and continues to be – enormous.”","https://www.facebook.com/godfreybloomofficial/videos/901998073707253,https://fullfact.org/health/facebook-post-makes-misleading-claims-about-covid-19-passports-and-death-rate/,https://fullfact.org/health/facebook-post-makes-misleading-claims-about-covid-19-passports-and-death-rate/,https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/government-faces-growing-backlash-over-vaccine-passport-plan-945001,https://fullfact.org/health/viral-video-contains-several-false-pandemic-claims/,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-vaccines-not-medical-experiment/,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting#conclusion-1,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,https://fullfact.org/health/facebook-post-makes-misleading-claims-about-covid-19-passports-and-death-rate/,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/vaccine-development,https://fullfact.org/online/rna-vaccine-covid/,https://fullfact.org/health/mrna-covid-vaccine/,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-vaccine-advice-for-adults-living-with-adults-who-are-immunosuppressed,https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2021/03/covid-vaccine-immune-cancer-patients.aspx,https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/,https://fullfact.org/online/bill-gates-has-not-bought-telegram/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/photo-of-mike-tyson-in-plan-demic-t-shirt-has-been-edited/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/lorraine-kelly-himalayas/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/no-evidence-rapper-dmx-had-covid-19-vaccine-his-death/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/priti-patel-eyebrows-ppe/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Godfrey Bloom video makes false claims about vaccines,,,,,,

The post says that therefore the vaccinations are unsafe and suggests that as a result, fact checkers have been spreading disinformation regarding the safety of the vaccines. In particular, the post states that studies on the three vaccines currently approved for use in the UK can’t have been peer-reviewed because they have not yet been completed.  The post includes links to the clinical trial registration pages of some of these vaccines. The post also lists their study completion dates, as all being in 2023.  Two of the three links offered in the Facebook post do link to the trial registration sites for Covid-19 vaccines (Pfizer and AstraZeneca). However, one of the links cited in the post connects to the registration page of a Moderna study using an mRNA vaccine to prevent the recurrence of melanoma rather than to a study of the Moderna vaccine for Covid-19. As such the quoted 2023 date for the completion of the Moderna vaccine in the facebook post is incorrect.  The trial completion dates are set in the future (to allow for long term follow up), however analyses of the data from phase three trials have been published in peer-reviewed studies in medical journals.  The post also shows a picture of a government website which says that as of March 2020 Covid-19 should no longer be classed a high consequence infectious disease. The Facebook post also says that Covid-19 is ‘nothing more than a flu’. As we have written about before, Covid-19 is no longer classed as a high consequence infectious disease but that does not mean that it is no longer considered dangerous or significant. We’ve also written many times about the fact Covid is more than just ‘a flu’. As for the claim that fact checkers are spreading misinformation, at Full Fact we aim to do exactly the opposite. We write articles to prevent the spread of bad information, and the harm that it can cause. We use reputable sources, and link to the evidence that we use so that readers can check it for themselves. The National Institute of Health clinical trials website (which is a database from the US National Library of Medicine of global private and publicly funded medical research studies) lists studies with a start date, estimated primary completion date and estimated secondary completion date.  For the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, for example the primary completion date is October 2021, and the estimated study completion date is April 2023.  The primary completion date is the date “on which the last participant in a clinical study was examined or received an intervention to collect final data for the primary outcome measure” and the estimated study completion date is the estimated date “on which the last participant in a clinical study was examined or received an intervention/treatment to collect final data for the primary outcome measures, secondary outcome measures and adverse events.”  For the Pfizer vaccine, the primary outcomes include reactions like pain at the injection site, systemic side effects like a fever or vomiting, and adverse events. Many of the secondary outcome measures involve examining or measuring samples from participants up to two years after their final vaccine. The completion date therefore has to be a few years in the future. Data on key outcomes such as efficacy and safety have therefore been published in peer-reviewed journals, however data on long term protection and safety will continue to be collected over the coming years.The three coronavirus vaccines currently approved for use in the UK through temporary authorisations have been through all the normal stages of vaccine testing, including animal and human studies. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulation Authority (MHRA), which approved the vaccines in the UK and conducts ongoing safety monitoring, has said that “Following widespread use of these vaccines across the UK, the vast majority of suspected adverse reaction reports so far confirm the safety profile seen in clinical trials.” It added: “The expected benefits of the vaccines in preventing COVID-19 and serious complications associated with COVID-19 far outweigh any currently known side effects.” In December 2020, the Pfizer and the Oxford-AstraZeneca research teams released their analyses of phase three safety and efficacy data. Moderna released theirs in February 2021. For Pfizer this was a peer-reviewed article in the New England Journal of Medicine including efficacy data from 43,500 participants (including placebo group), with two month safety data from 37,700 participants. For Oxford-AstraZeneca, this was a peer reviewed article in The Lancet, including interim analysis data from around 11,600 participants (although 23,800 participants were included in the wider trial) from April-November 2020. Moderna’s data was also peer-reviewed and released in the New England Journal of Medicine and included data from approximately 30,400 participants (15,200 of whom received the vaccine rather than a placebo). The second image included in the Facebook post, is a picture of a genuine page on the UK government website. The website says that as of “19 March 2020, COVID-19 is no longer considered to be a high consequence infectious disease in the UK”. This is correct, but needs more context. We wrote about this in 2020. A high consequence infectious disease (HCID) is an acute infectious disease which meets certain criteria, for example it has a particularly high case fatality rate, a lack of treatment or way to prevent infection, it is difficult to diagnose, easy to transmit or spread, or it requires an ‘enhanced’ response.  In January 2020, the HCID group recommended that Covid-19 be classified as a HCID. However, by March there was awareness that the mortality rates were lower than initially feared, there was improved clinical awareness, and an accurate test for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19) was available. As a result Covid-19 was removed from the list of HCIDs.  Just because Covid-19 is not considered a HCID, does not mean it is not of importance. To put it into context, there are currently only 18 infectious diseases or strains of infectious diseases on the HCID list. One of them, Ebola Virus Disease, has a case fatality rate of 25-90%.   There are many significant infectious diseases that are of concern, but may not meet HCID criteria. For example, three of the leading causes of infectious disease related deaths globally: tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and malaria.  We’ve previously written many times about why Covid-19 is more than ‘just a flu’. We’ve fact checked incorrect claims that Covid-19 is no worse than a bad flu season or that deaths from flu have been higher than Covid-19 (when in fact Covid deaths have been higher), or that flu deaths are being widely miscategorised as Covid-19 (which is also incorrect). We’ve also written before about the fact that while there has been a reduction of flu over the last year there is no evidence to suggest that Covid-19 is simply influenza in a new guise. Not least because they are caused by different viruses.","https://www.facebook.com/lee.dawson.921677/posts/198547022076362,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04516746,https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04368728,https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03897881,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04470427,https://www.gov.uk/guidance/high-consequence-infectious-diseases-hcid#status-of-covid-19,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-hcid/,https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04516746,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04516746,https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04368728,https://www.modernatx.com/modernas-work-potential-vaccine-against-covid-19,https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/covid-19-vaccine-azd1222-showed-robust-immune-responses-in-all-participants-in-phase-i-ii-trial.html,https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/astrazeneca-us-vaccine-trial-met-primary-endpoint.html,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-share-positive-early-data-lead-mrna,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-confirm-high-efficacy-and-no-serious,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/vaccine-development,https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-positive-interim-phase-1-data-its-mrna-vaccine,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-data-preclinical-studies-mrna,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting#conclusion-1,https://www.nejm.org/media-center/publication-process,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577#article_references,https://www.thelancet.com/publishing-excellence#peer,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03504-w,https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2932661-1,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2035389,https://www.gov.uk/guidance/high-consequence-infectious-diseases-hcid#status-of-covid-19,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-hcid/,https://www.gov.uk/guidance/high-consequence-infectious-diseases-hcid#status-of-covid-19,https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease,https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-flu-season-david-kurten/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-19-is-not-flu/,https://fullfact.org/health/flu-covid-deaths/,https://fullfact.org/online/flu-not-eradicated/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-19-is-not-flu/,https://fullfact.org/health/lateral-flow/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/puppies-canine-coronavirus/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/express-covid-risk-pregnancy/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/32-vaccinated-hospital/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-vaccine-shedding-side-effects-unvaccinated/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Results of Covid-19 vaccine trials have been published and peer-reviewed,,,,,,

The European Super League would involve 20 clubs, including 15 founder members which would be guaranteed entry to the tournament each year, and five clubs which had qualified for that year’s competition. The announcement has been received with almost universal negativity across the continent, so you might question the need for angry supporters to fabricate yet more dissent, attributed to some of the game’s most famous people.  For example, Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp has been reported as saying that the announcement is about “greed”, he is “against this Super League” and has “demanded a meeting with John”, presumably referring to John Henry, owner of Liverpool Football Club. Liverpool are one of the “Founding Clubs” of the European Super League.   Despite them being shared thousands of times on social media, there is no record of Mr Klopp ever having said these exact words, although he has expressed opposition to the idea of a super league in the past. After Liverpool’s 1-1 draw to Leeds United on Monday night, he said: “In 2019 I said it already...no I don’t think it’s a great idea.” In 2019, he told German magazine Kicker: ""I hope there will never be this Super League”. The fake quote appears to originate from a Twitter user called @_Sadio_Escobar who has history making up other fake quotes attributed to footballers associated with Liverpool, They initially told Full Fact via direct message: “I have a very trusted source within the Training compound, Kirkby. I get exclusive access to the players and coaching staff.”  They then said: “No realistically it’s just a bit of fun really. I find it interesting how people will believe anything they see just because there’s a picture next to some text. If it’s something people want to believe is true, they won’t question it.  “And I can’t believe people will believe a source called Sadio Escobar.  “I mean, look at my avatar”.  @_Sadio_Escobar's avatar   Similarly, a “quote” from Sir Alex Ferguson, former manager of Manchester United, another founder club, claims he said the Super League is a “piece of nonsense” and “sells [supporters] right down the river.” The quote has been shared by SPORTbible on Instagram and has been liked almost 170,000 times at the time of writing.  The quote appears to have gone viral after football journalist Michael Cox tweeted it, saying it was the former manager’s views “on the breakaway league”. He explained in a subsequent tweet that Sir Alex originally said this about the formation of the Premier League in 1992, not the European Super League. We can’t find any evidence that Sir Alex has ever said this about any competition. We have approached Mr Cox and LADbible Group, owners of SPORTbible for comment.  However, Sir Alex did tell Reuters on Sunday that “talk of a Super League is a move away from 70 years of European club football”.  And on Monday, after Tottenham Hotspur sacked manager Jose Mourinho, Twitter user @thechichoazul claimed this was after he “refused to take players onto training ground over the club’s proposed Super League admission.”  There is no evidence that Mr Mourinho was sacked for these reasons. Spurs currently sit seventh in the Premier League after winning one of their past five league games and were knocked out of the Europa League by Dinamo Zagreb last month.

The account goes by the name “Trevor Azul” and has previously claimed to be employed by the Financial Times (which has denied his employment).  On Sunday night he claimed that Newcastle, who sit 15th in the Premier League, would be the next team to join the European Super League with the full “story to follow”.  No story followed.","https://thesuperleague.com/,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/56801498,https://twitter.com/georgegalloway/status/1384129676784726016,https://www.liverpoolfc.com/corporate/directors,https://www.facebook.com/TheFootyCommunity/photos/a.915355615198577/4168216669912439/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/awaydaysatthefootball/photos/a.242409089297683/1601559540049291/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/FootballAwayDaysClub/photos/a.377104322835326/896668420878911/?type=3&theater,https://twitter.com/thisisanfield/status/1384276920221593626,https://www.kicker.de/klopp_ich-hoffe-diese-super-league-wird-es-nie-geben-756347/artikel,https://twitter.com/_Sadio_Escobar/status/1383936438140506123,https://twitter.com/_Sadio_Escobar/status/1370336982623264769/photo/1,https://twitter.com/_Sadio_Escobar/status/1378479360668221441/photo/1,https://www.instagram.com/p/CN2g4s6sYFZ/,https://www.instagram.com/p/CN2g4s6sYFZ/,https://twitter.com/Zonal_Marking/status/1384057156345896967,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-europe-ferguson-idUKKBN2C50J7,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/56799400,https://twitter.com/thechicoazul/status/1384075142406361091,https://www.premierleague.com/tables,https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/fixtures/men/,https://twitter.com/muradahmed/status/1383847977047920641,https://twitter.com/thechicoazul/status/1383842618052800512,https://fullfact.org/news/investigations-adviser-ministers-interests/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/boris-johnson-james-dyson-texts-share/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/guardian-conservative-poll-support-cummings/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/what-happens-when-pupils-test-positive-covid-19/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/news/did-eat-out-help-out-cause-covid-spread/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Fake football quotes go viral,,,,,,
9,,,,Other,Grace Rahman,2021-04-16,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/online/third-wave-model-vaccine/,A document on the UK government website says the third wave of deaths will come from the vaccine.,2021-04-16,fullfact,,"A video spreading on Instagram claims to show evidence of the government saying that the third wave of deaths during the pandemic will come from vaccines. The person recording the video can be heard saying: “People need to read this: ‘The resurgence in both hospitalisations and deaths is dominated by those that have received two doses,’ read it, ‘of the vaccine, comprising around 60% and 70%’. So what they’re saying here is that the vaccine doesn’t work.” The video shows a genuine government document, and the voice in the video does correctly quote parts of it. But an important piece of context follows, which is not mentioned in the video. The document then says: “This can be attributed to the high levels of uptake in the most at-risk age groups, such that immunisation failures account for more serious illness than unvaccinated individuals.” So the model is expecting that by a certain point, because so many people will have been vaccinated, most of those in hospital during a third wave will have been vaccinated. The vaccines are not 100% effective, so a small proportion of vaccinated people, especially those in older age groups who are more likely to be hospitalised with Covid-19 (who are also more likely to be vaccinated), will still end up in hospital. The paper expands more on this later, saying that it’s expected that most hospitalisations and deaths in a later resurgence will be in those who’ve had two vaccine doses, because uptake of the vaccine in those most vulnerable to severe Covid-19 has been so high, not because the vaccine doesn’t work.  A third wave of deaths and hospitalisations is expected, not because of the vaccine, but because of the planned spring easing of restrictions. The document was written by SPI-M-O, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, Operational sub-group, which reports to SAGE, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, which in turn advises the government. SPI-M-O looked at various models for what could happen, coming out of different universities (in this case Imperial College London, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the University of Warwick). There have been multiple studies that show the three vaccines approved for use in the UK, made by Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca, are highly effective against severe Covid-19.","https://www.instagram.com/tv/CNX7a9oAUfK/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link,https://www.instagram.com/tv/CNariYcA-JL/?utm_source=ig_embed,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/975909/S1182_SPI-M-O_Summary_of_modelling_of_easing_roadmap_step_2_restrictions.pdf#page=10,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/975909/S1182_SPI-M-O_Summary_of_modelling_of_easing_roadmap_step_2_restrictions.pdf#page=18,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/975909/S1182_SPI-M-O_Summary_of_modelling_of_easing_roadmap_step_2_restrictions.pdf#page=9,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spi-m-o-summary-of-further-modelling-of-easing-restrictions-roadmap-step-2-31-march-2021,https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/scientific-advisory-group-for-emergencies-sage,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2035389,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/azd1222-us-phase-iii-primary-analysis-confirms-safety-and-efficacy.html,https://fullfact.org/online/bill-gates-has-not-bought-telegram/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/photo-of-mike-tyson-in-plan-demic-t-shirt-has-been-edited/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/lorraine-kelly-himalayas/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/no-evidence-rapper-dmx-had-covid-19-vaccine-his-death/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/priti-patel-eyebrows-ppe/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",The government hasn’t said the vaccine will cause a third wave of deaths,,,,,,

12,,,,True,Tom Norton,2021-04-13,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/health/facebook-post-makes-misleading-claims-about-covid-19-passports-and-death-rate/,Covid-19 vaccines don’t prevent infection or transmission of the disease.,2021-04-13,fullfact,,"A Facebook post that has been shared more than 3,000 times claims: “We’re about to be forced to have a digital ID, proving we’ve had an experimental vaccine, which doesn’t prevent infection or transmission of a virus that most of us have 0.05% chance of dying from, so we can live ‘normal life’. Can people really not see through this?” The claims in this post are largely false or misleading.  The claim regarding a “digital ID” appears to refer to Covid-19 vaccine certificates (also known as vaccine passports). These are documents which would prove a person’s Covid-19 vaccination or infection status. These are not currently mandated by the UK government.  The government has published a Roadmap Reviews paper which discusses how certificates could be used in everyday life. The paper includes details of a government-led Events Research Programme, which will run a number of trials in April and May to test how Covid status certificates could be used to reintroduce large public events like football matches and concerts, and reduce border restrictions for travellers. It also states how businesses will legally be able to ask for proof of Covid-19 status from customers, provided doing so doesn’t break equality laws.  If certificates are formally introduced, the government says it is unlikely anyone would require a certificate to access essential shops, essential public services and public transport and people for whom vaccination isn’t advised and repeat testing is difficult are likely to be exempt from such a scheme.  However, talks are ongoing; vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi recently said certification is “only one option” while some MPs say they will vote against it if it is brought to parliament.   Therefore, with no legislated policy, clear indications there will be exemptions and more debate (or even a vote) on the matter, there isn’t enough evidence to suggest that Covid-19 passports will be mandatory or “forced”.  It is also not true the vaccines are “experimental”. The three Covid-19 vaccines currently approved for use in the UK have already been shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials.  Some of the vaccines used in the UK are mRNA vaccines. While these are the first mRNA vaccines to be rolled out to the general public, the technology behind mRNA vaccines has been developed over a number of years. Both mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would. It’s normal that authorities continue to monitor the safety of these vaccines even after they have been approved. This monitoring happens with all vaccines, including those that have been in use for years, to detect any adverse effects. Just because studies into these vaccines are continuing, doesn’t mean the vaccines are experimental. As we have said before, vaccines significantly reduce the risk of developing Covid-19.  Clinical trials have shown recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 95% less likely to contract Covid-19 compared to placebo treatment while the Moderna vaccine has been shown to be 94% effective. Recent trials of the AstraZeneca vaccine showed it was 76% effective against symptomatic Covid-19, 100% effective against severe or critical disease and hospitalisation, and 85% effective against symptomatic Covid-19 in participants aged 65 years and older.  And while the risk of transmission does not disappear following vaccination, initial evidence suggests vaccines help stop the spread of the SARS-Cov-2 virus which causes Covid-19.  The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) notes that there is only one study on the impact of vaccination on the risk of transmission so far, a Scottish study which has not yet been peer-reviewed, which suggested vaccination of a household member reduced the risk of infection to susceptible households by at least 30%.  However, the ECDC also stated “the total number of infections is expected to decrease significantly as vaccination coverage increases, provided that there is a match between the vaccine strains and the circulating virus strains” which would “lead to decreased transmission overall.” It is very difficult to calculate an accurate death rate for Covid-19, because we do not know exactly how many people have been infected and therefore what proportion of people have died.  The post claims there is a 0.05% death rate for Covid-19 for “most of us” but doesn’t clarify what “most of us” means. It appears to be based on a systematic review of Covid-19 studies, from Stanford University, which suggests that only 1 in 2,000 people (0.05%) under the age of 70 infected with Covid-19 would die from the disease. .  The review has been disputed by epidemiologists who say the death rate varies greatly among age groups. One peer review noted the populations sampled in the review varied “greatly” which was “inappropriate to analyse” together and that the infection fatality rate estimated was “lower than those reported in multiple other studies”.  The review also did not thoroughly examine the effect of pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and lung disease, which are associated with severity of Covid-19 symptoms and mortality.  It’s also unclear whether the reference to “most of us” in the Facebook post does mean under 70s. According to the World Health Organization, estimates suggest that the overall death rate for Covid-19 is somewhere between 0.5% and 1% of all people who catch it.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10218728493105647&set=a.1333683664355&type=3&theater,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/975919/20210405_Roadmap_Reviews_-_Update_-_standard_size_-_FINAL.pdf,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/975919/20210405_Roadmap_Reviews_-_Update_-_standard_size_-_FINAL.pdf#page=8,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/975919/20210405_Roadmap_Reviews_-_Update_-_standard_size_-_FINAL.pdf#page=5,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/covid-vaccine-passports-shops-trains-b1826938.html,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/975919/20210405_Roadmap_Reviews_-_Update_-_standard_size_-_FINAL.pdf,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-56645208,https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/government-faces-growing-backlash-over-vaccine-passport-plan-945001,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/vaccine-development,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine#date-of-first-authorisationrenewal-of-the-authorisation,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-covid-19-vaccine-moderna,https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/azd1222-us-phase-iii-primary-analysis-confirms-safety-and-efficacy.html,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,https://www.publichealthscotland.scot/news/2021/march/covid-19-vaccine-linked-to-a-reduction-in-transmission/,https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/sars-cov-2-transmission-newly-infected-individuals-previous-infection,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.20101253v3.full,https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-9243914747,https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/research/2020/12/synopsis-ioannidis-studies-covid-19-infection-fatality-rates.pdf?la=en,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314621/,https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/estimating-mortality-from-covid-19,https://fullfact.org/health/lateral-flow/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/puppies-canine-coronavirus/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/express-covid-risk-pregnancy/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/32-vaccinated-hospital/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-vaccine-shedding-side-effects-unvaccinated/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Facebook post makes misleading claims about Covid-19 passports and death rate,,,,,,

The paper includes details of a government-led Events Research Programme, which will run a number of trials in April and May to test how Covid status certificates could be used to reintroduce large public events like football matches and concerts, and reduce border restrictions for travellers. It also states how businesses will legally be able to ask for proof of Covid-19 status from customers, provided doing so doesn’t break equality laws.  If certificates are formally introduced, the government says it is unlikely anyone would require a certificate to access essential shops, essential public services and public transport and people for whom vaccination isn’t advised and repeat testing is difficult are likely to be exempt from such a scheme.  However, talks are ongoing; vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi recently said certification is “only one option” while some MPs say they will vote against it if it is brought to parliament.   Therefore, with no legislated policy, clear indications there will be exemptions and more debate (or even a vote) on the matter, there isn’t enough evidence to suggest that Covid-19 passports will be mandatory or “forced”.  It is also not true the vaccines are “experimental”. The three Covid-19 vaccines currently approved for use in the UK have already been shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials.  Some of the vaccines used in the UK are mRNA vaccines. While these are the first mRNA vaccines to be rolled out to the general public, the technology behind mRNA vaccines has been developed over a number of years. Both mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would. It’s normal that authorities continue to monitor the safety of these vaccines even after they have been approved. This monitoring happens with all vaccines, including those that have been in use for years, to detect any adverse effects. Just because studies into these vaccines are continuing, doesn’t mean the vaccines are experimental. As we have said before, vaccines significantly reduce the risk of developing Covid-19.  Clinical trials have shown recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 95% less likely to contract Covid-19 compared to placebo treatment while the Moderna vaccine has been shown to be 94% effective. Recent trials of the AstraZeneca vaccine showed it was 76% effective against symptomatic Covid-19, 100% effective against severe or critical disease and hospitalisation, and 85% effective against symptomatic Covid-19 in participants aged 65 years and older.  And while the risk of transmission does not disappear following vaccination, initial evidence suggests vaccines help stop the spread of the SARS-Cov-2 virus which causes Covid-19.  The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) notes that there is only one study on the impact of vaccination on the risk of transmission so far, a Scottish study which has not yet been peer-reviewed, which suggested vaccination of a household member reduced the risk of infection to susceptible households by at least 30%.  However, the ECDC also stated “the total number of infections is expected to decrease significantly as vaccination coverage increases, provided that there is a match between the vaccine strains and the circulating virus strains” which would “lead to decreased transmission overall.” It is very difficult to calculate an accurate death rate for Covid-19, because we do not know exactly how many people have been infected and therefore what proportion of people have died.  The post claims there is a 0.05% death rate for Covid-19 for “most of us” but doesn’t clarify what “most of us” means. It appears to be based on a systematic review of Covid-19 studies, from Stanford University, which suggests that only 1 in 2,000 people (0.05%) under the age of 70 infected with Covid-19 would die from the disease. .  The review has been disputed by epidemiologists who say the death rate varies greatly among age groups. One peer review noted the populations sampled in the review varied “greatly” which was “inappropriate to analyse” together and that the infection fatality rate estimated was “lower than those reported in multiple other studies”.  The review also did not thoroughly examine the effect of pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and lung disease, which are associated with severity of Covid-19 symptoms and mortality.  It’s also unclear whether the reference to “most of us” in the Facebook post does mean under 70s. According to the World Health Organization, estimates suggest that the overall death rate for Covid-19 is somewhere between 0.5% and 1% of all people who catch it.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10218728493105647&set=a.1333683664355&type=3&theater,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/975919/20210405_Roadmap_Reviews_-_Update_-_standard_size_-_FINAL.pdf,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/975919/20210405_Roadmap_Reviews_-_Update_-_standard_size_-_FINAL.pdf#page=8,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/975919/20210405_Roadmap_Reviews_-_Update_-_standard_size_-_FINAL.pdf#page=5,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/covid-vaccine-passports-shops-trains-b1826938.html,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/975919/20210405_Roadmap_Reviews_-_Update_-_standard_size_-_FINAL.pdf,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-56645208,https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/government-faces-growing-backlash-over-vaccine-passport-plan-945001,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/vaccine-development,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine#date-of-first-authorisationrenewal-of-the-authorisation,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-covid-19-vaccine-moderna,https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/azd1222-us-phase-iii-primary-analysis-confirms-safety-and-efficacy.html,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,https://www.publichealthscotland.scot/news/2021/march/covid-19-vaccine-linked-to-a-reduction-in-transmission/,https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/sars-cov-2-transmission-newly-infected-individuals-previous-infection,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.20101253v3.full,https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-9243914747,https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/research/2020/12/synopsis-ioannidis-studies-covid-19-infection-fatality-rates.pdf?la=en,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314621/,https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/estimating-mortality-from-covid-19,https://fullfact.org/health/lateral-flow/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/puppies-canine-coronavirus/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/express-covid-risk-pregnancy/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/32-vaccinated-hospital/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-vaccine-shedding-side-effects-unvaccinated/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Facebook post makes misleading claims about Covid-19 passports and death rate,,,,,,

15,,,,True,Pippa Allen-Kinross,2021-04-09,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/economy/poverty-not-same-food-insecurity/,At the beginning of 2020 there were 4.3 million children growing up in poverty.,2021-04-09,fullfact,,"In a speech to the NASUWT teaching union on 3 April, shadow education secretary Kate Green claimed that 4.3 million children are living in poverty, and in families that struggle to “put food on the table”.  Although poverty is often linked to struggling to afford food, data collected by the government shows that these can be two distinct issues. Putting enough food on the table is a real struggle for many families, but not everyone classed as living in poverty also suffers from food insecurity. According to the latest official data, there were 4.3 million children living in relative poverty in 2019/20. Of these, 26% (1.1 million) live in households classed as “food insecure”, roughly meaning that they do struggle to put food on the table.  As we have written before, there are several different ways to measure poverty. The most commonly used measures are relative and absolute poverty. Someone is counted as in relative low income (or in relative poverty) if their household income is below 60% of the national median average that year. This can be calculated both before and after housing costs. Absolute poverty looks at the number of people in households where the income is below 60% of the average median level in 2010/11, adjusted for inflation. Ms Green said there were 4.3 million children in poverty at the start of 2020. Data published by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) does show that, in the year to April 2020, 4.28 million children (30.7%) in the UK were classed as being in relative low income households after housing costs.  Ms Green said these children were “growing up in families that were struggling to pay the bills or put food on the table.” However, this is not necessarily correct.  The DWP data comes from the annual Family Resources Survey, a representative survey of around 19,000 households in the UK. This survey now also asks families about their food security.  It found that 87% of households in the UK had high food security, meaning they had “no problem, or anxiety about, consistently accessing adequate food”. A further 6% had marginal food security, and were also classed as being “food secure”. The remaining households were split between low food security and very low food security. The data shows that, of the 4.3 million children in relative low income households in 2019/20, 3.2 million (74%) were classed as being “food secure”.  Of these children, 2.6 million had “high” food security and 0.6 million had “marginal” food security, meaning their families had “problems at times, or anxiety about, accessing adequate food, but the quality, variety, and quantity of their food intake were not substantially reduced” and so are considered to be food secure.  This measure does not capture things like the nutritional value of the food, and previous research has suggested many families in the UK may not be able afford the extra costs of more healthy eating. However, it does mean that it is incorrect to say that all 4.3 million children in relative poverty live in families which are “struggling to... put food on the table”.  Ms Green’s office told Full Fact that this line in the speech had been rhetorical to include examples of what being in poverty means for children and families affected, and was not meant to suggest that every one of these children is facing food insecurity or going hungry. The Family Resources Survey does not collect data on the number of households who struggle to pay bills. Poverty is also measured by the Social Metrics Commission, which has said that before the Covid crisis, nearly three in ten people in poverty were in families that were behind on paying the bills. Ms Green also said that, in the last 10 years, the number of children growing up in poverty increased by almost 700,000. But, keeping to the same measure she was using previously, the data shows that the number of children in relative poverty after housing costs has risen by more like 400,000 - from 3.87 million in 2009/10 to 4.28 million in 2019/20. In percentage terms, this is a 1.3 percentage point increase from 29.4% of children in 2009/10 to 30.7% in 2019/20.   Ms Green’s office told Full Fact that the increase of 700,000 came from using the figures from 2010/11, rather than 2009/10, when 3.6 million children were classed as in relative poverty. We’ve written before about how poverty statistics can be used to make political points.","https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/households-below-average-income-for-financial-years-ending-1995-to-2020,https://fullfact.org/economy/poverty-uk-guide-facts-and-figures/,https://fullfact.org/economy/october-2020-poverty-rates/,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/875261/households-below-average-income-1994-1995-2018-2019.pdf#page=2,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/875261/households-below-average-income-1994-1995-2018-2019.pdf#page=2,https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/households-below-average-income-for-financial-years-ending-1995-to-2020,https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/family-resources-survey-financial-year-2019-to-2020/family-resources-survey-financial-year-2019-to-2020#household-food-security-1,https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/households-below-average-income-for-financial-years-ending-1995-to-2020,https://foodfoundation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Affordability-of-the-Eatwell-Guide_Final_Web-Version.pdf,https://socialmetricscommission.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Measuring-Poverty-2020-Web.pdf,https://fullfact.org/economy/october-2020-poverty-rates/,https://fullfact.org/economy/levelling-up-fund-index/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/economy/transport-for-north-budget/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/economy/coronavirus-job-loss-guardian/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/economy/eu-exports-january-2021/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/economy/11-million-cladding-crisis/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Poverty is not the same as food insecurity,,,,,,
16,,,,True,Sarah Turnnidge,2021-04-09,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/health/astrazeneca-vaccine-risk-comparison/,You’re far more likely to die in a car crash this year.,2021-04-09,fullfact,,"On Wednesday the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said the likelihood of getting a blood clot after a dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is approximately four in a million.  Of the 79 cases reported to the MHRA, 19 patients had died. This has been reported as a one-in-a-million risk of dying from a blood clot after having a dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine.  In a bid to reduce public anxiety about the MHRA’s announcement, some news outlets have compared these likelihoods to other statistically extremely unlikely events, such as being killed by a cow or having your home hit by a plane falling from the sky.  We’ve taken a look at some of the claims.  In a Q&A section of Thursday’s paper, The Sun claimed that “you are almost as likely to be killed by a cow” as you are to develop a serious blood clot from the vaccine. It said being killed by a cow had a likelihood of one in 300,000, compared to one in 250,000 for developing a serious blood clot. The Sun didn’t list a source for its cow claim.  The risk of being killed by a cow seems lower than this, but it is in the same ballpark as actually dying of one of these fatal clots after vaccination which, as said, is around one in a million.  In September 2020 the Guardian quoted figures from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), which monitors such incidents, showing that between March 2000 and March 2020, 98 people had been killed by cattle in the UK.  Over roughly the same period (2000-2019) in the UK there were around 11.7 million deaths, meaning cows are responsible for around one in a million deaths.  However, of the deaths recorded by the HSE, 22 were members of the public. The rest were either farmers or farm workers. So your likelihood of dying from a cow is much lower than your likelihood of dying from a blood clot after being vaccinated, if you’re not a farmer. In the same Q&A section of the paper, The Sun also claimed a person is “far more likely” to die in a car crash this year than develop a serious blood clot from the AstraZeneca vaccine. It said the likelihood of this was one in 20,000.  Again, The Sun doesn’t source this claim, but if you Google search ‘likelihood of death in car accident UK’, or similar search terms, it is the first number that appears in the results.  This number appears on the online version of Bandolier, which describes itself as an “independent journal about evidence-based healthcare, written by Oxford scientists”. The most recent post on the site appears to be from 2010.  A page on the site states: “While the risk of dying in a road accident in any year in the UK approaches 1 in 20,000, the lifetime risk is 1 in 240.” According to the sources listed on the page, this figure has been calculated using Department of Transport data from 2004, now 17 years out of date.  More recent data on road deaths in Great Britain is from the year ending June 2019, during which 1,870 fatalities were recorded. This number includes people in cars, pedestrians, motorcyclists, cyclists and ‘other’ road users.  Using the ONS population estimate for mid-2019, the likelihood of dying in a road accident over the period of a single year across the entire population works out at approximately one in 35,720. One in 310 deaths in 2019 was a road death. This means it is correct to say you are more likely to die in a crash this year than develop serious blood clots from the AstraZeneca vaccine. In Thursday’s edition of its London Playbook newsletter, POLITICO quoted figures from the British Medical Journal (BMJ), which states that there’s a one in 250,000 chance of being hit in your home by a plane falling out of the sky.  The BMJ lists its source for this figure as a book called Up to Your Armpits in Alligators?

17,,,,True,Sarah Turnnidge,2021-04-09,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/health/astrazeneca-vaccine-risk-comparison/,You’re far more likely to die in a car crash this year.,2021-04-09,fullfact,,"On Wednesday the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said the likelihood of getting a blood clot after a dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is approximately four in a million.  Of the 79 cases reported to the MHRA, 19 patients had died. This has been reported as a one-in-a-million risk of dying from a blood clot after having a dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine.  In a bid to reduce public anxiety about the MHRA’s announcement, some news outlets have compared these likelihoods to other statistically extremely unlikely events, such as being killed by a cow or having your home hit by a plane falling from the sky.  We’ve taken a look at some of the claims.  In a Q&A section of Thursday’s paper, The Sun claimed that “you are almost as likely to be killed by a cow” as you are to develop a serious blood clot from the vaccine. It said being killed by a cow had a likelihood of one in 300,000, compared to one in 250,000 for developing a serious blood clot. The Sun didn’t list a source for its cow claim.  The risk of being killed by a cow seems lower than this, but it is in the same ballpark as actually dying of one of these fatal clots after vaccination which, as said, is around one in a million.  In September 2020 the Guardian quoted figures from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), which monitors such incidents, showing that between March 2000 and March 2020, 98 people had been killed by cattle in the UK.  Over roughly the same period (2000-2019) in the UK there were around 11.7 million deaths, meaning cows are responsible for around one in a million deaths.  However, of the deaths recorded by the HSE, 22 were members of the public. The rest were either farmers or farm workers. So your likelihood of dying from a cow is much lower than your likelihood of dying from a blood clot after being vaccinated, if you’re not a farmer. In the same Q&A section of the paper, The Sun also claimed a person is “far more likely” to die in a car crash this year than develop a serious blood clot from the AstraZeneca vaccine. It said the likelihood of this was one in 20,000.  Again, The Sun doesn’t source this claim, but if you Google search ‘likelihood of death in car accident UK’, or similar search terms, it is the first number that appears in the results.  This number appears on the online version of Bandolier, which describes itself as an “independent journal about evidence-based healthcare, written by Oxford scientists”. The most recent post on the site appears to be from 2010.  A page on the site states: “While the risk of dying in a road accident in any year in the UK approaches 1 in 20,000, the lifetime risk is 1 in 240.” According to the sources listed on the page, this figure has been calculated using Department of Transport data from 2004, now 17 years out of date.  More recent data on road deaths in Great Britain is from the year ending June 2019, during which 1,870 fatalities were recorded. This number includes people in cars, pedestrians, motorcyclists, cyclists and ‘other’ road users.  Using the ONS population estimate for mid-2019, the likelihood of dying in a road accident over the period of a single year across the entire population works out at approximately one in 35,720. One in 310 deaths in 2019 was a road death. This means it is correct to say you are more likely to die in a crash this year than develop serious blood clots from the AstraZeneca vaccine. In Thursday’s edition of its London Playbook newsletter, POLITICO quoted figures from the British Medical Journal (BMJ), which states that there’s a one in 250,000 chance of being hit in your home by a plane falling out of the sky.  The BMJ lists its source for this figure as a book called Up to Your Armpits in Alligators? How to Sort Out What Risks are Worth Worrying About!, published by an academic at the Risk Communication and Environmental Institute, Gainesville, Florida in 1997.  While listed by the BMJ as a reasonable way of explaining risk in a healthcare context, it’s likely that this figure from more than 20 years ago, calculated in the US, doesn’t represent  the risk to a UK citizen in 2021.  According to data collated by the World Bank, the number of passengers carried via plane in a year almost tripled between 1997 and 2019, indicating a significant increase in the amount of air traffic worldwide.

There are a number of false or misleading claims in this video. This article considers some of them. There are  many other claims included in the video that we have not checked, which may or may not be true.    We have written about this topic previously.  All three of the vaccines that are currently being used in the UK have passed the normal stages of clinical trials and have been shown to be safe and effective.  The AstraZeneca vaccine uses a technique that had already been successfully used against other infections.  The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, are mRNA vaccines. They are the first mRNA vaccines to be rolled out to the general public.  However, as we have written before, it is wrong to call them “experimental”, because they have already been proven to be safe and effective in clinical trials.   The article shown in the video also says: “Historically only patients who demonstrated actual symptoms of an illness were considered a case. Publishing positive test results as “CASES"" is grossly misleading and needlessly alarming.” This is misleading.  Professor of Health Protection with a specialism in medical microbiology, Professor Paul Hunter, told Full Fact: “We often do count asymptomatic infections for other infectious diseases especially where asymptomatic individuals pose a risk to others as is the case with COVID”. He also cautioned that this is important because “for COVID the big issue is that truly asymptomatic people can still and do transmit the infection”. A “case” is classified by a case definition which sets the criteria for the diagnosis of a condition or infection. A case definition may include clinical criteria (symptoms), laboratory testing, and sometimes specific epidemiological stipulations on a time period or location.  Somebody may test positive for an infectious disease long before having symptoms, and this would be considered a case. Other examples of infectious conditions that may be asymptomatic but would be considered a “case” after a positive test include certain forms of hepatitis, malaria, forms of polio, varicella zoster (which causes chicken pox).  Public Health England uses the following case definition for counting confirmed Covid-19 cases in England: “COVID-19 cases are identified by taking specimens from people and testing them for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. If the test is positive, this is referred to as a case.” Testing asymptomatic people for infection, and counting them as a case if they test positive is not unusual practice.    This claim has been previously fact checked by Reuters.  It comes from a paper from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which did show that both 85% of positive Covid-19 cases and 89% of people who tested negative reported wearing masks always or often.  The study was not designed to investigate the impact of mask wearing in general on transmission of Covid. Its focus was on the risks of going to places where masks are difficult to use. It found that similar proportions of people with and without Covid went shopping, which may be easy to do with a mask, in the two weeks before becoming ill. On the other hand, 41% of people testing positive for Covid-19 went to a restaurant, where masks are difficult to wear, compared with only 28% of the people who tested negative.  A CDC spokesperson, Jason McDonald, told Reuters: “The aim of the study was to assess possible situations for community exposure, not mask use.” The study, McDonald noted, found that “going to places where mask use and social distancing cannot be maintained...might be an important risk factor for COVID-19.” There is some evidence that surgical masks and face coverings can reduce transmission of Covid-19. The potential benefit of mask wearing has also been demonstrated for other respiratory viruses.    Bill Gates has been the subject of many Covid-19 conspiracy theories. A common claim is that Bill Gates is using vaccinations to reduce the world’s population and enact a eugenics programme.  This has been previously fact checked by Reuters and Snopes and originates from claims that Mr Gates said that “three billion people need to die”, and that his dad “ran” Planned Parenthood.  Mr Gates was alleged to have said “three billion people need to die” by a man speaking at the “International Tribunal for Natural Justice”. There is no evidence that Mr Gates ever said this. What he did say, in a TED talk in 2010, was that:  “The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent. But there, we see an increase of about 1.3. ” The talk was about reducing global carbon dioxide emissions to zero. It was not describing a plan to use vaccinations to kill people. In fact, his hope for vaccinations is quite the opposite—that good healthcare would lower the risk of death, thereby encouraging parents to have fewer children. This is about slowing the growth of the world population, not reducing the population that exists now. In an article in Forbes in 2011, Mr Gates said that whilst his initial work in public health focused on contraception, he switched focus to vaccinations, when it became clear that reduced mortality rates and better childhood survival allows individuals to make the choice to reduce their family size, and therefore reduces birth rates.  Full Fact has previously written about many other false claims about Mr Gates before.","https://fullfact.org/online/war-criminals-covid/,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55041371,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/viralvector.html,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna/information-for-uk-recipients-on-covid-19-vaccine-moderna,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-vaccines-not-medical-experiment/,https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson1/section5.html,https://www.kdheks.gov/epi/download/Standard_Infectious_Disease_Case_Classifications.pdf,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/about-data#daily-and-cumulative-numbers-of-cases,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-cdc-study-exposure-idUSKBN2741WF,https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/pdfs/mm6936a5-H.pdf,https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/pdfs/mm6936a5-H.pdf#page=4,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(21)00003-0/fulltext,https://rs-delve.github.io/addenda/2020/07/07/masks-update.html#fn:20,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/892043/S0484_Transmission_of_SARS-CoV-2_and_Mitigating_Measures.pdf#page=23,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-newspaper-idUSKBN27X2VR,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bill-gates-planned-parenthood/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bill-gates-planned-parenthood/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjnEz5s37o&t=5583s,https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_innovating_to_zero/transcript#t-1302897,https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2011/11/02/the-second-coming-of-bill-gates/?sh=b1d652913fd5,https://fullfact.org/health/bill-gates-chips-bbc/,https://fullfact.org/online/gates-polio-vaccine/,https://fullfact.org/online/gates-patent-vaccine-wuhan-lab/,https://fullfact.org/health/lateral-flow/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/puppies-canine-coronavirus/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/express-covid-risk-pregnancy/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/32-vaccinated-hospital/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-vaccine-shedding-side-effects-unvaccinated/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Viral video contains several false pandemic claims,,,,,,

20,,,,Other,Daniella de Block Golding,2021-04-07,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/health/viral-video-contains-several-false-pandemic-claims/,85% of people who test positive for Covid wore masks always or often.,2021-04-07,fullfact,,"A viral video on Facebook includes a number of false and misleading claims about the Covid-19 pandemic.  The video consists of a woman recommending a publication in New Zealand called The Real News, which she summarises and reads from. There are a number of false or misleading claims in this video. This article considers some of them. There are  many other claims included in the video that we have not checked, which may or may not be true.    We have written about this topic previously.  All three of the vaccines that are currently being used in the UK have passed the normal stages of clinical trials and have been shown to be safe and effective.  The AstraZeneca vaccine uses a technique that had already been successfully used against other infections.  The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, are mRNA vaccines. They are the first mRNA vaccines to be rolled out to the general public.  However, as we have written before, it is wrong to call them “experimental”, because they have already been proven to be safe and effective in clinical trials.   The article shown in the video also says: “Historically only patients who demonstrated actual symptoms of an illness were considered a case. Publishing positive test results as “CASES"" is grossly misleading and needlessly alarming.” This is misleading.  Professor of Health Protection with a specialism in medical microbiology, Professor Paul Hunter, told Full Fact: “We often do count asymptomatic infections for other infectious diseases especially where asymptomatic individuals pose a risk to others as is the case with COVID”. He also cautioned that this is important because “for COVID the big issue is that truly asymptomatic people can still and do transmit the infection”. A “case” is classified by a case definition which sets the criteria for the diagnosis of a condition or infection. A case definition may include clinical criteria (symptoms), laboratory testing, and sometimes specific epidemiological stipulations on a time period or location.  Somebody may test positive for an infectious disease long before having symptoms, and this would be considered a case. Other examples of infectious conditions that may be asymptomatic but would be considered a “case” after a positive test include certain forms of hepatitis, malaria, forms of polio, varicella zoster (which causes chicken pox).  Public Health England uses the following case definition for counting confirmed Covid-19 cases in England: “COVID-19 cases are identified by taking specimens from people and testing them for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. If the test is positive, this is referred to as a case.” Testing asymptomatic people for infection, and counting them as a case if they test positive is not unusual practice.    This claim has been previously fact checked by Reuters.  It comes from a paper from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which did show that both 85% of positive Covid-19 cases and 89% of people who tested negative reported wearing masks always or often.  The study was not designed to investigate the impact of mask wearing in general on transmission of Covid. Its focus was on the risks of going to places where masks are difficult to use. It found that similar proportions of people with and without Covid went shopping, which may be easy to do with a mask, in the two weeks before becoming ill. On the other hand, 41% of people testing positive for Covid-19 went to a restaurant, where masks are difficult to wear, compared with only 28% of the people who tested negative.  A CDC spokesperson, Jason McDonald, told Reuters: “The aim of the study was to assess possible situations for community exposure, not mask use.” The study, McDonald noted, found that “going to places where mask use and social distancing cannot be maintained...might be an important risk factor for COVID-19.” There is some evidence that surgical masks and face coverings can reduce transmission of Covid-19. The potential benefit of mask wearing has also been demonstrated for other respiratory viruses.    Bill Gates has been the subject of many Covid-19 conspiracy theories. A common claim is that Bill Gates is using vaccinations to reduce the world’s population and enact a eugenics programme.  This has been previously fact checked by Reuters and Snopes and originates from claims that Mr Gates said that “three billion people need to die”, and that his dad “ran” Planned Parenthood.  Mr Gates was alleged to have said “three billion people need to die” by a man speaking at the “International Tribunal for Natural Justice”. There is no evidence that Mr Gates ever said this. What he did say, in a TED talk in 2010, was that:  “The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent. But there, we see an increase of about 1.3. ” The talk was about reducing global carbon dioxide emissions to zero. It was not describing a plan to use vaccinations to kill people. In fact, his hope for vaccinations is quite the opposite—that good healthcare would lower the risk of death, thereby encouraging parents to have fewer children. This is about slowing the growth of the world population, not reducing the population that exists now. In an article in Forbes in 2011, Mr Gates said that whilst his initial work in public health focused on contraception, he switched focus to vaccinations, when it became clear that reduced mortality rates and better childhood survival allows individuals to make the choice to reduce their family size, and therefore reduces birth rates.  Full Fact has previously written about many other false claims about Mr Gates before.","https://fullfact.org/online/war-criminals-covid/,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55041371,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/viralvector.html,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna/information-for-uk-recipients-on-covid-19-vaccine-moderna,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-vaccines-not-medical-experiment/,https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson1/section5.html,https://www.kdheks.gov/epi/download/Standard_Infectious_Disease_Case_Classifications.pdf,https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/about-data#daily-and-cumulative-numbers-of-cases,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-cdc-study-exposure-idUSKBN2741WF,https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/pdfs/mm6936a5-H.pdf,https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/pdfs/mm6936a5-H.pdf#page=4,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(21)00003-0/fulltext,https://rs-delve.github.io/addenda/2020/07/07/masks-update.html#fn:20,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/892043/S0484_Transmission_of_SARS-CoV-2_and_Mitigating_Measures.pdf#page=23,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-newspaper-idUSKBN27X2VR,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bill-gates-planned-parenthood/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bill-gates-planned-parenthood/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjnEz5s37o&t=5583s,https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_innovating_to_zero/transcript#t-1302897,https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2011/11/02/the-second-coming-of-bill-gates/?sh=b1d652913fd5,https://fullfact.org/health/bill-gates-chips-bbc/,https://fullfact.org/online/gates-polio-vaccine/,https://fullfact.org/online/gates-patent-vaccine-wuhan-lab/,https://fullfact.org/health/lateral-flow/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/puppies-canine-coronavirus/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/express-covid-risk-pregnancy/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/32-vaccinated-hospital/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-vaccine-shedding-side-effects-unvaccinated/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Viral video contains several false pandemic claims,,,,,,

The clip has been taken from a longer video which has been circulating on social media for a while.  In the UK, three Covid-19 vaccines have been approved for use made by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca. All of these vaccines have been found to be safe and effective. In clinical trials the Pfizer vaccine was 95% effective, meaning the number of infections among people who were given the vaccine was 95% lower than the number in the group that wasn’t.  While mild to moderate side effects such as nausea, tiredness and pain around the injection site, are common, these tend to pass quickly.  The Moderna vaccine reduced cases of symptomatic Covid-19 by 94% and all cases of “severe Covid-19” occurred in the group who were not vaccinated.  Like the Pfizer vaccine, the Moderna vaccine commonly produced mild or moderate side effects which passed quickly, but the rate of severe side effects was similar in both the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.  The vaccines may cause allergic reactions and so people with a history of allergic reactions, especially to any of the ingredients, should inform healthcare staff beforehand.   The latest data on the AstraZeneca vaccine shows it reduces the rate of symptomatic Covid-19 by 76%, and is 100% effective against severe or critical Covid-19 and hospitalisation. Previous safety data showed the rate of serious adverse events was no higher in the group which received this Covid-19 vaccine than the control group, who either received a meningitis vaccine or a saline solution. The Covid-19 vaccines have been developed much more quickly than previous vaccines. There are good reasons for this. For one, a lot of the groundwork had already been done. Years of developing mRNA vaccine technology and working on vaccines against other coronaviruses like SARS meant researchers had a headstart with Covid-19 vaccines.  The AstraZeneca vaccine is not an mRNA vaccine, but uses a technique that had already been successfully used to vaccinate against other infections.  Money was also a factor. A lot of the time it takes to develop vaccines is spent waiting for funding. With Covid-19, the global need for a vaccine was so great that funding was more accessible than usual.  Nevertheless, the vaccines in use have all passed multiple stages of animal and human trials and been shown to be safe and effective.  The claim that vaccines will change your DNA is false, and has its roots in the fact that some of the Covid-19 vaccines, including the Pfizer vaccine, contain mRNA, which is chemically similar to DNA.  The mRNA in these vaccines is essentially code which instructs the human body on how to build proteins which are found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus which causes Covid-19.  This, in turn, prompts the immune system to build antibodies to those proteins meaning that, if the vaccinated person then actually contracts the virus, they already have the protective antibodies which will recognise the surface proteins and attack the harmful virus. But this RNA doesn’t come into contact with human DNA (which is stored in the nucleus of cells) let alone change it. Even if it could enter the nucleus, it can’t merge with human DNA or get converted in DNA. We’ve fact checked similar claims several times before. The British Fertility Society says: “There is absolutely no evidence, and no theoretical reason, that any of the vaccines can affect the fertility of women or men.” We’ve written about this several times before.  The NHS also says that anyone planning to get pregnant doesn’t need to avoid the vaccine. We have written many times about the differences between Covid-19 and seasonal flu in terms of mortality. The deaths caused by Covid-19 in the period between January 2020 and March 2021 are far greater than the deaths caused by flu for the same period.  Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for England and Wales shows that 119,728 people died with Covid-19 as the underlying cause of death, compared to 23,406 people dying with flu and pneumonia as the underlying cause of death between January 2020 up to March 2021.  We do not yet have the figures for 2020, but for 2019 for flu alone (excluding pneumonia), this figure was much smaller, and was the direct cause of 1,213 deaths.  2020 saw far fewer cases of flu than previous years, and so perhaps isn’t a fair comparison. However, figures from Public Health England (PHE) for the last five years show that there were 11,292 deaths per year on average associated with flu in England. The year with the highest number of deaths in that period was 2017/2018, when there were 22,087 deaths associated with flu. This is far fewer than the number we have seen over the past year directly caused by, or even related to Covid-19. The definition of a pandemic is “an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people”.  The Covid-19 crisis meets this criteria, and Covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation in March 2020.  We’ve checked similar claims before.  Although some have claimed that the inventor of the Polymerase Chain Reaction, Kary B Mullis, who died before the pandemic, said that PCR tests could not detect infections, this is a mis-quote.  Confusion seems to have arisen from quotes of his in a 1996 article about HIV and AIDS. The author actually quotes Dr Mullis as saying “Quantitative PCR is an oxymoron” within the context of testing viral load (the amount of virus present) in people with HIV. This doesn’t mean he thought PCR testing didn’t work at all, but that there are limitations in detecting the specific levels of a virus from a sample using PCR testing. PCR is the gold standard test for SARS-CoV-2 as mandated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Public Health England (PHE). Like all tests, there are some false negatives and false positive results associated with PCR testing, however overall it is thought to be very effective. We have previously written about how PCR tests work, and how effective they are. Two of the vaccines approved for use in the UK are mRNA vaccines (the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines). While these are the first mRNA vaccines to be rolled out to the general public, the technology behind mRNA vaccines has been developed over a number of years.   Both mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would.","https://www.facebook.com/100008490394924/videos/vb.100008490394924/2573640559595599/?type=2&theater,https://www.bitchute.com/video/H9GyqoPMvfRa/,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-medicines-regulator-gives-approval-for-first-uk-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/moderna-vaccine-becomes-third-covid-19-vaccine-approved-by-uk-regulator,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/oxford-universityastrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-approved,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2035389,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/,https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/azd1222-us-phase-iii-primary-analysis-confirms-safety-and-efficacy.html,https://www.thelancet.com/cms/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32661-1/attachment/75bff1ea-804f-4c66-adc1-2f7d0f9b4550/mmc1.pdf#page=16,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03626-1,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55041371,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03626-1,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://www.pfizer.com/news/hot-topics/the_facts_about_pfizer_and_biontech_s_covid_19_vaccine,https://www.rnasociety.org/what-is-rna,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://fullfact.org/online/rna-vaccine-covid/,https://fullfact.org/online/moderna-vaccine-not-change-dna/,http://www.britishfertilitysociety.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Covid19-Vaccines-FAQ-1_3.pdf,https://fullfact.org/health/vaccine-covid-fertility/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-vaccine-nanoparticles/,https://fullfact.org/online/placenta-protein-vaccine/,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwmIuDBhDXARIsAFITC_63hmLKEsK6dIt5XUnqrBq7zjeCf_s_Ys6lFjpEK3HT5beKEyx-ElUaAstmEALw_wcB,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-flu-season-david-kurten/,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-figures-talk-radio/,https://fullfact.org/online/flu-not-eradicated/,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending5march2021,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending12march2021#deaths-registered-by-week,https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/construct/summary.asp?mode=construct&version=0&dataset=161,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/895233/Surveillance_Influenza_and_other_respiratory_viruses_in_the_UK_2019_to_2020_FINAL.pdf#page=54,https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/7/11-088815/en/,https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020,https://fullfact.org/online/pcr-test-mullis/,https://www.facebook.com/ProgressiveTruthSeekers/photos/a.325627377817371/1172730303107070/?type=3&theater,http://www.virusmyth.org/aids/hiv/jlprotease.htm,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-59524-0_3,https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/diagnostic-testing-for-sars-cov-2,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/889795/Assay_Validation_Situation_update_report.pdf,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-pcr-test-accuracy/,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna/information-for-uk-recipients-on-covid-19-vaccine-moderna,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html,https://fullfact.org/online/war-criminals-covid/,https://fullfact.org/health/lateral-flow/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/puppies-canine-coronavirus/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/express-covid-risk-pregnancy/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/32-vaccinated-hospital/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-vaccine-shedding-side-effects-unvaccinated/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Social media video makes false claims about Covid-19,,,,,,

PCR is the gold standard test for SARS-CoV-2 as mandated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Public Health England (PHE). Like all tests, there are some false negatives and false positive results associated with PCR testing, however overall it is thought to be very effective. We have previously written about how PCR tests work, and how effective they are. Two of the vaccines approved for use in the UK are mRNA vaccines (the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines). While these are the first mRNA vaccines to be rolled out to the general public, the technology behind mRNA vaccines has been developed over a number of years.   Both mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would.","https://www.facebook.com/100008490394924/videos/vb.100008490394924/2573640559595599/?type=2&theater,https://www.bitchute.com/video/H9GyqoPMvfRa/,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-medicines-regulator-gives-approval-for-first-uk-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/moderna-vaccine-becomes-third-covid-19-vaccine-approved-by-uk-regulator,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/oxford-universityastrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-approved,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2035389,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/,https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/azd1222-us-phase-iii-primary-analysis-confirms-safety-and-efficacy.html,https://www.thelancet.com/cms/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32661-1/attachment/75bff1ea-804f-4c66-adc1-2f7d0f9b4550/mmc1.pdf#page=16,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03626-1,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55041371,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03626-1,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://www.pfizer.com/news/hot-topics/the_facts_about_pfizer_and_biontech_s_covid_19_vaccine,https://www.rnasociety.org/what-is-rna,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://fullfact.org/online/rna-vaccine-covid/,https://fullfact.org/online/moderna-vaccine-not-change-dna/,http://www.britishfertilitysociety.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Covid19-Vaccines-FAQ-1_3.pdf,https://fullfact.org/health/vaccine-covid-fertility/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-vaccine-nanoparticles/,https://fullfact.org/online/placenta-protein-vaccine/,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwmIuDBhDXARIsAFITC_63hmLKEsK6dIt5XUnqrBq7zjeCf_s_Ys6lFjpEK3HT5beKEyx-ElUaAstmEALw_wcB,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-flu-season-david-kurten/,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-figures-talk-radio/,https://fullfact.org/online/flu-not-eradicated/,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending5march2021,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending12march2021#deaths-registered-by-week,https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/construct/summary.asp?mode=construct&version=0&dataset=161,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/895233/Surveillance_Influenza_and_other_respiratory_viruses_in_the_UK_2019_to_2020_FINAL.pdf#page=54,https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/7/11-088815/en/,https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020,https://fullfact.org/online/pcr-test-mullis/,https://www.facebook.com/ProgressiveTruthSeekers/photos/a.325627377817371/1172730303107070/?type=3&theater,http://www.virusmyth.org/aids/hiv/jlprotease.htm,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-59524-0_3,https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/diagnostic-testing-for-sars-cov-2,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/889795/Assay_Validation_Situation_update_report.pdf,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-pcr-test-accuracy/,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna/information-for-uk-recipients-on-covid-19-vaccine-moderna,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html,https://fullfact.org/online/war-criminals-covid/,https://fullfact.org/health/lateral-flow/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/puppies-canine-coronavirus/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/express-covid-risk-pregnancy/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/32-vaccinated-hospital/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-vaccine-shedding-side-effects-unvaccinated/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Social media video makes false claims about Covid-19,,,,,,

The clip has been taken from a longer video which has been circulating on social media for a while.  In the UK, three Covid-19 vaccines have been approved for use made by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca. All of these vaccines have been found to be safe and effective. In clinical trials the Pfizer vaccine was 95% effective, meaning the number of infections among people who were given the vaccine was 95% lower than the number in the group that wasn’t.  While mild to moderate side effects such as nausea, tiredness and pain around the injection site, are common, these tend to pass quickly.  The Moderna vaccine reduced cases of symptomatic Covid-19 by 94% and all cases of “severe Covid-19” occurred in the group who were not vaccinated.  Like the Pfizer vaccine, the Moderna vaccine commonly produced mild or moderate side effects which passed quickly, but the rate of severe side effects was similar in both the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.  The vaccines may cause allergic reactions and so people with a history of allergic reactions, especially to any of the ingredients, should inform healthcare staff beforehand.   The latest data on the AstraZeneca vaccine shows it reduces the rate of symptomatic Covid-19 by 76%, and is 100% effective against severe or critical Covid-19 and hospitalisation. Previous safety data showed the rate of serious adverse events was no higher in the group which received this Covid-19 vaccine than the control group, who either received a meningitis vaccine or a saline solution. The Covid-19 vaccines have been developed much more quickly than previous vaccines. There are good reasons for this. For one, a lot of the groundwork had already been done. Years of developing mRNA vaccine technology and working on vaccines against other coronaviruses like SARS meant researchers had a headstart with Covid-19 vaccines.  The AstraZeneca vaccine is not an mRNA vaccine, but uses a technique that had already been successfully used to vaccinate against other infections.  Money was also a factor. A lot of the time it takes to develop vaccines is spent waiting for funding. With Covid-19, the global need for a vaccine was so great that funding was more accessible than usual.  Nevertheless, the vaccines in use have all passed multiple stages of animal and human trials and been shown to be safe and effective.  The claim that vaccines will change your DNA is false, and has its roots in the fact that some of the Covid-19 vaccines, including the Pfizer vaccine, contain mRNA, which is chemically similar to DNA.  The mRNA in these vaccines is essentially code which instructs the human body on how to build proteins which are found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus which causes Covid-19.  This, in turn, prompts the immune system to build antibodies to those proteins meaning that, if the vaccinated person then actually contracts the virus, they already have the protective antibodies which will recognise the surface proteins and attack the harmful virus. But this RNA doesn’t come into contact with human DNA (which is stored in the nucleus of cells) let alone change it. Even if it could enter the nucleus, it can’t merge with human DNA or get converted in DNA. We’ve fact checked similar claims several times before. The British Fertility Society says: “There is absolutely no evidence, and no theoretical reason, that any of the vaccines can affect the fertility of women or men.” We’ve written about this several times before.  The NHS also says that anyone planning to get pregnant doesn’t need to avoid the vaccine. We have written many times about the differences between Covid-19 and seasonal flu in terms of mortality. The deaths caused by Covid-19 in the period between January 2020 and March 2021 are far greater than the deaths caused by flu for the same period.  Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for England and Wales shows that 119,728 people died with Covid-19 as the underlying cause of death, compared to 23,406 people dying with flu and pneumonia as the underlying cause of death between January 2020 up to March 2021.  We do not yet have the figures for 2020, but for 2019 for flu alone (excluding pneumonia), this figure was much smaller, and was the direct cause of 1,213 deaths.  2020 saw far fewer cases of flu than previous years, and so perhaps isn’t a fair comparison. However, figures from Public Health England (PHE) for the last five years show that there were 11,292 deaths per year on average associated with flu in England. The year with the highest number of deaths in that period was 2017/2018, when there were 22,087 deaths associated with flu. This is far fewer than the number we have seen over the past year directly caused by, or even related to Covid-19. The definition of a pandemic is “an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people”.  The Covid-19 crisis meets this criteria, and Covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation in March 2020.  We’ve checked similar claims before.  Although some have claimed that the inventor of the Polymerase Chain Reaction, Kary B Mullis, who died before the pandemic, said that PCR tests could not detect infections, this is a mis-quote.  Confusion seems to have arisen from quotes of his in a 1996 article about HIV and AIDS. The author actually quotes Dr Mullis as saying “Quantitative PCR is an oxymoron” within the context of testing viral load (the amount of virus present) in people with HIV. This doesn’t mean he thought PCR testing didn’t work at all, but that there are limitations in detecting the specific levels of a virus from a sample using PCR testing.

While these are the first mRNA vaccines to be rolled out to the general public, the technology behind mRNA vaccines has been developed over a number of years.   Both mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would.","https://www.facebook.com/100008490394924/videos/vb.100008490394924/2573640559595599/?type=2&theater,https://www.bitchute.com/video/H9GyqoPMvfRa/,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-medicines-regulator-gives-approval-for-first-uk-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/moderna-vaccine-becomes-third-covid-19-vaccine-approved-by-uk-regulator,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/oxford-universityastrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-approved,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2035389,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/,https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/azd1222-us-phase-iii-primary-analysis-confirms-safety-and-efficacy.html,https://www.thelancet.com/cms/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32661-1/attachment/75bff1ea-804f-4c66-adc1-2f7d0f9b4550/mmc1.pdf#page=16,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03626-1,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55041371,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03626-1,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://www.pfizer.com/news/hot-topics/the_facts_about_pfizer_and_biontech_s_covid_19_vaccine,https://www.rnasociety.org/what-is-rna,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://fullfact.org/online/rna-vaccine-covid/,https://fullfact.org/online/moderna-vaccine-not-change-dna/,http://www.britishfertilitysociety.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Covid19-Vaccines-FAQ-1_3.pdf,https://fullfact.org/health/vaccine-covid-fertility/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-vaccine-nanoparticles/,https://fullfact.org/online/placenta-protein-vaccine/,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwmIuDBhDXARIsAFITC_63hmLKEsK6dIt5XUnqrBq7zjeCf_s_Ys6lFjpEK3HT5beKEyx-ElUaAstmEALw_wcB,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-flu-season-david-kurten/,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-figures-talk-radio/,https://fullfact.org/online/flu-not-eradicated/,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending5march2021,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending12march2021#deaths-registered-by-week,https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/construct/summary.asp?mode=construct&version=0&dataset=161,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/895233/Surveillance_Influenza_and_other_respiratory_viruses_in_the_UK_2019_to_2020_FINAL.pdf#page=54,https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/7/11-088815/en/,https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020,https://fullfact.org/online/pcr-test-mullis/,https://www.facebook.com/ProgressiveTruthSeekers/photos/a.325627377817371/1172730303107070/?type=3&theater,http://www.virusmyth.org/aids/hiv/jlprotease.htm,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-59524-0_3,https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/diagnostic-testing-for-sars-cov-2,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/889795/Assay_Validation_Situation_update_report.pdf,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-pcr-test-accuracy/,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna/information-for-uk-recipients-on-covid-19-vaccine-moderna,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html,https://fullfact.org/online/war-criminals-covid/,https://fullfact.org/health/lateral-flow/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/puppies-canine-coronavirus/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/express-covid-risk-pregnancy/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/32-vaccinated-hospital/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-vaccine-shedding-side-effects-unvaccinated/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Social media video makes false claims about Covid-19,,,,,,

The clip has been taken from a longer video which has been circulating on social media for a while.  In the UK, three Covid-19 vaccines have been approved for use made by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca. All of these vaccines have been found to be safe and effective. In clinical trials the Pfizer vaccine was 95% effective, meaning the number of infections among people who were given the vaccine was 95% lower than the number in the group that wasn’t.  While mild to moderate side effects such as nausea, tiredness and pain around the injection site, are common, these tend to pass quickly.  The Moderna vaccine reduced cases of symptomatic Covid-19 by 94% and all cases of “severe Covid-19” occurred in the group who were not vaccinated.  Like the Pfizer vaccine, the Moderna vaccine commonly produced mild or moderate side effects which passed quickly, but the rate of severe side effects was similar in both the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.  The vaccines may cause allergic reactions and so people with a history of allergic reactions, especially to any of the ingredients, should inform healthcare staff beforehand.   The latest data on the AstraZeneca vaccine shows it reduces the rate of symptomatic Covid-19 by 76%, and is 100% effective against severe or critical Covid-19 and hospitalisation. Previous safety data showed the rate of serious adverse events was no higher in the group which received this Covid-19 vaccine than the control group, who either received a meningitis vaccine or a saline solution. The Covid-19 vaccines have been developed much more quickly than previous vaccines. There are good reasons for this. For one, a lot of the groundwork had already been done. Years of developing mRNA vaccine technology and working on vaccines against other coronaviruses like SARS meant researchers had a headstart with Covid-19 vaccines.  The AstraZeneca vaccine is not an mRNA vaccine, but uses a technique that had already been successfully used to vaccinate against other infections.  Money was also a factor. A lot of the time it takes to develop vaccines is spent waiting for funding. With Covid-19, the global need for a vaccine was so great that funding was more accessible than usual.  Nevertheless, the vaccines in use have all passed multiple stages of animal and human trials and been shown to be safe and effective.  The claim that vaccines will change your DNA is false, and has its roots in the fact that some of the Covid-19 vaccines, including the Pfizer vaccine, contain mRNA, which is chemically similar to DNA.  The mRNA in these vaccines is essentially code which instructs the human body on how to build proteins which are found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus which causes Covid-19.  This, in turn, prompts the immune system to build antibodies to those proteins meaning that, if the vaccinated person then actually contracts the virus, they already have the protective antibodies which will recognise the surface proteins and attack the harmful virus. But this RNA doesn’t come into contact with human DNA (which is stored in the nucleus of cells) let alone change it. Even if it could enter the nucleus, it can’t merge with human DNA or get converted in DNA. We’ve fact checked similar claims several times before. The British Fertility Society says: “There is absolutely no evidence, and no theoretical reason, that any of the vaccines can affect the fertility of women or men.” We’ve written about this several times before.  The NHS also says that anyone planning to get pregnant doesn’t need to avoid the vaccine. We have written many times about the differences between Covid-19 and seasonal flu in terms of mortality. The deaths caused by Covid-19 in the period between January 2020 and March 2021 are far greater than the deaths caused by flu for the same period.  Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for England and Wales shows that 119,728 people died with Covid-19 as the underlying cause of death, compared to 23,406 people dying with flu and pneumonia as the underlying cause of death between January 2020 up to March 2021.  We do not yet have the figures for 2020, but for 2019 for flu alone (excluding pneumonia), this figure was much smaller, and was the direct cause of 1,213 deaths.  2020 saw far fewer cases of flu than previous years, and so perhaps isn’t a fair comparison. However, figures from Public Health England (PHE) for the last five years show that there were 11,292 deaths per year on average associated with flu in England. The year with the highest number of deaths in that period was 2017/2018, when there were 22,087 deaths associated with flu. This is far fewer than the number we have seen over the past year directly caused by, or even related to Covid-19. The definition of a pandemic is “an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people”.  The Covid-19 crisis meets this criteria, and Covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation in March 2020.  We’ve checked similar claims before.  Although some have claimed that the inventor of the Polymerase Chain Reaction, Kary B Mullis, who died before the pandemic, said that PCR tests could not detect infections, this is a mis-quote.  Confusion seems to have arisen from quotes of his in a 1996 article about HIV and AIDS. The author actually quotes Dr Mullis as saying “Quantitative PCR is an oxymoron” within the context of testing viral load (the amount of virus present) in people with HIV. This doesn’t mean he thought PCR testing didn’t work at all, but that there are limitations in detecting the specific levels of a virus from a sample using PCR testing. PCR is the gold standard test for SARS-CoV-2 as mandated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Public Health England (PHE). Like all tests, there are some false negatives and false positive results associated with PCR testing, however overall it is thought to be very effective. We have previously written about how PCR tests work, and how effective they are. Two of the vaccines approved for use in the UK are mRNA vaccines (the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines).

While these are the first mRNA vaccines to be rolled out to the general public, the technology behind mRNA vaccines has been developed over a number of years.   Both mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would.","https://www.facebook.com/100008490394924/videos/vb.100008490394924/2573640559595599/?type=2&theater,https://www.bitchute.com/video/H9GyqoPMvfRa/,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-medicines-regulator-gives-approval-for-first-uk-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/moderna-vaccine-becomes-third-covid-19-vaccine-approved-by-uk-regulator,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/oxford-universityastrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-approved,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2035389,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/,https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/azd1222-us-phase-iii-primary-analysis-confirms-safety-and-efficacy.html,https://www.thelancet.com/cms/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32661-1/attachment/75bff1ea-804f-4c66-adc1-2f7d0f9b4550/mmc1.pdf#page=16,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03626-1,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55041371,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03626-1,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://www.pfizer.com/news/hot-topics/the_facts_about_pfizer_and_biontech_s_covid_19_vaccine,https://www.rnasociety.org/what-is-rna,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://fullfact.org/online/rna-vaccine-covid/,https://fullfact.org/online/moderna-vaccine-not-change-dna/,http://www.britishfertilitysociety.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Covid19-Vaccines-FAQ-1_3.pdf,https://fullfact.org/health/vaccine-covid-fertility/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-vaccine-nanoparticles/,https://fullfact.org/online/placenta-protein-vaccine/,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwmIuDBhDXARIsAFITC_63hmLKEsK6dIt5XUnqrBq7zjeCf_s_Ys6lFjpEK3HT5beKEyx-ElUaAstmEALw_wcB,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-flu-season-david-kurten/,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-figures-talk-radio/,https://fullfact.org/online/flu-not-eradicated/,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending5march2021,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending12march2021#deaths-registered-by-week,https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/construct/summary.asp?mode=construct&version=0&dataset=161,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/895233/Surveillance_Influenza_and_other_respiratory_viruses_in_the_UK_2019_to_2020_FINAL.pdf#page=54,https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/7/11-088815/en/,https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020,https://fullfact.org/online/pcr-test-mullis/,https://www.facebook.com/ProgressiveTruthSeekers/photos/a.325627377817371/1172730303107070/?type=3&theater,http://www.virusmyth.org/aids/hiv/jlprotease.htm,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-59524-0_3,https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/diagnostic-testing-for-sars-cov-2,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/889795/Assay_Validation_Situation_update_report.pdf,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-pcr-test-accuracy/,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna/information-for-uk-recipients-on-covid-19-vaccine-moderna,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html,https://fullfact.org/online/war-criminals-covid/,https://fullfact.org/health/lateral-flow/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/puppies-canine-coronavirus/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/express-covid-risk-pregnancy/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/32-vaccinated-hospital/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-vaccine-shedding-side-effects-unvaccinated/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Social media video makes false claims about Covid-19,,,,,,

The clip has been taken from a longer video which has been circulating on social media for a while.  In the UK, three Covid-19 vaccines have been approved for use made by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca. All of these vaccines have been found to be safe and effective. In clinical trials the Pfizer vaccine was 95% effective, meaning the number of infections among people who were given the vaccine was 95% lower than the number in the group that wasn’t.  While mild to moderate side effects such as nausea, tiredness and pain around the injection site, are common, these tend to pass quickly.  The Moderna vaccine reduced cases of symptomatic Covid-19 by 94% and all cases of “severe Covid-19” occurred in the group who were not vaccinated.  Like the Pfizer vaccine, the Moderna vaccine commonly produced mild or moderate side effects which passed quickly, but the rate of severe side effects was similar in both the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.  The vaccines may cause allergic reactions and so people with a history of allergic reactions, especially to any of the ingredients, should inform healthcare staff beforehand.   The latest data on the AstraZeneca vaccine shows it reduces the rate of symptomatic Covid-19 by 76%, and is 100% effective against severe or critical Covid-19 and hospitalisation. Previous safety data showed the rate of serious adverse events was no higher in the group which received this Covid-19 vaccine than the control group, who either received a meningitis vaccine or a saline solution. The Covid-19 vaccines have been developed much more quickly than previous vaccines. There are good reasons for this. For one, a lot of the groundwork had already been done. Years of developing mRNA vaccine technology and working on vaccines against other coronaviruses like SARS meant researchers had a headstart with Covid-19 vaccines.  The AstraZeneca vaccine is not an mRNA vaccine, but uses a technique that had already been successfully used to vaccinate against other infections.  Money was also a factor. A lot of the time it takes to develop vaccines is spent waiting for funding. With Covid-19, the global need for a vaccine was so great that funding was more accessible than usual.  Nevertheless, the vaccines in use have all passed multiple stages of animal and human trials and been shown to be safe and effective.  The claim that vaccines will change your DNA is false, and has its roots in the fact that some of the Covid-19 vaccines, including the Pfizer vaccine, contain mRNA, which is chemically similar to DNA.  The mRNA in these vaccines is essentially code which instructs the human body on how to build proteins which are found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus which causes Covid-19.  This, in turn, prompts the immune system to build antibodies to those proteins meaning that, if the vaccinated person then actually contracts the virus, they already have the protective antibodies which will recognise the surface proteins and attack the harmful virus. But this RNA doesn’t come into contact with human DNA (which is stored in the nucleus of cells) let alone change it. Even if it could enter the nucleus, it can’t merge with human DNA or get converted in DNA. We’ve fact checked similar claims several times before. The British Fertility Society says: “There is absolutely no evidence, and no theoretical reason, that any of the vaccines can affect the fertility of women or men.” We’ve written about this several times before.  The NHS also says that anyone planning to get pregnant doesn’t need to avoid the vaccine. We have written many times about the differences between Covid-19 and seasonal flu in terms of mortality. The deaths caused by Covid-19 in the period between January 2020 and March 2021 are far greater than the deaths caused by flu for the same period.  Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for England and Wales shows that 119,728 people died with Covid-19 as the underlying cause of death, compared to 23,406 people dying with flu and pneumonia as the underlying cause of death between January 2020 up to March 2021.  We do not yet have the figures for 2020, but for 2019 for flu alone (excluding pneumonia), this figure was much smaller, and was the direct cause of 1,213 deaths.  2020 saw far fewer cases of flu than previous years, and so perhaps isn’t a fair comparison. However, figures from Public Health England (PHE) for the last five years show that there were 11,292 deaths per year on average associated with flu in England. The year with the highest number of deaths in that period was 2017/2018, when there were 22,087 deaths associated with flu. This is far fewer than the number we have seen over the past year directly caused by, or even related to Covid-19. The definition of a pandemic is “an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people”.  The Covid-19 crisis meets this criteria, and Covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation in March 2020.  We’ve checked similar claims before.  Although some have claimed that the inventor of the Polymerase Chain Reaction, Kary B Mullis, who died before the pandemic, said that PCR tests could not detect infections, this is a mis-quote.  Confusion seems to have arisen from quotes of his in a 1996 article about HIV and AIDS. The author actually quotes Dr Mullis as saying “Quantitative PCR is an oxymoron” within the context of testing viral load (the amount of virus present) in people with HIV. This doesn’t mean he thought PCR testing didn’t work at all, but that there are limitations in detecting the specific levels of a virus from a sample using PCR testing. PCR is the gold standard test for SARS-CoV-2 as mandated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Public Health England (PHE). Like all tests, there are some false negatives and false positive results associated with PCR testing, however overall it is thought to be very effective. We have previously written about how PCR tests work, and how effective they are. Two of the vaccines approved for use in the UK are mRNA vaccines (the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines). While these are the first mRNA vaccines to be rolled out to the general public, the technology behind mRNA vaccines has been developed over a number of years.   Both mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would.","https://www.facebook.com/100008490394924/videos/vb.100008490394924/2573640559595599/?type=2&theater,https://www.bitchute.com/video/H9GyqoPMvfRa/,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-medicines-regulator-gives-approval-for-first-uk-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/moderna-vaccine-becomes-third-covid-19-vaccine-approved-by-uk-regulator,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/oxford-universityastrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-approved,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2035389,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/,https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/azd1222-us-phase-iii-primary-analysis-confirms-safety-and-efficacy.html,https://www.thelancet.com/cms/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32661-1/attachment/75bff1ea-804f-4c66-adc1-2f7d0f9b4550/mmc1.pdf#page=16,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03626-1,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55041371,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03626-1,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://www.pfizer.com/news/hot-topics/the_facts_about_pfizer_and_biontech_s_covid_19_vaccine,https://www.rnasociety.org/what-is-rna,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://fullfact.org/online/rna-vaccine-covid/,https://fullfact.org/online/moderna-vaccine-not-change-dna/,http://www.britishfertilitysociety.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Covid19-Vaccines-FAQ-1_3.pdf,https://fullfact.org/health/vaccine-covid-fertility/,https://fullfact.org/online/covid-vaccine-nanoparticles/,https://fullfact.org/online/placenta-protein-vaccine/,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwmIuDBhDXARIsAFITC_63hmLKEsK6dIt5XUnqrBq7zjeCf_s_Ys6lFjpEK3HT5beKEyx-ElUaAstmEALw_wcB,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-flu-season-david-kurten/,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-figures-talk-radio/,https://fullfact.org/online/flu-not-eradicated/,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending5march2021,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending12march2021#deaths-registered-by-week,https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/construct/summary.asp?mode=construct&version=0&dataset=161,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/895233/Surveillance_Influenza_and_other_respiratory_viruses_in_the_UK_2019_to_2020_FINAL.pdf#page=54,https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/7/11-088815/en/,https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020,https://fullfact.org/online/pcr-test-mullis/,https://www.facebook.com/ProgressiveTruthSeekers/photos/a.325627377817371/1172730303107070/?type=3&theater,http://www.virusmyth.org/aids/hiv/jlprotease.htm,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-59524-0_3,https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/diagnostic-testing-for-sars-cov-2,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/889795/Assay_Validation_Situation_update_report.pdf,https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-pcr-test-accuracy/,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna/information-for-uk-recipients-on-covid-19-vaccine-moderna,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html,https://fullfact.org/online/war-criminals-covid/,https://fullfact.org/health/lateral-flow/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/puppies-canine-coronavirus/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/express-covid-risk-pregnancy/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/32-vaccinated-hospital/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/health/covid-vaccine-shedding-side-effects-unvaccinated/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",Social media video makes false claims about Covid-19,,,,,,

This may have made buying a house less affordable (although this is also affected by changing interest rates), but not to the extent that the chart on this post suggested.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158244082254480&set=a.10150236931874480&type=3,https://twitter.com/socialistsunday/status/1320420016915943426,https://landregistry.data.gov.uk/app/ukhpi/doc?lang=en,https://landregistry.data.gov.uk/app/ukhpi/browse?from=1990-01-01&location=http%3A%2F%2Flandregistry.data.gov.uk%2Fid%2Fregion%2Funited-kingdom&to=2020-12-01&lang=en,https://landregistry.data.gov.uk/app/ukhpi/browse?from=1990-01-01&location=http%3A%2F%2Flandregistry.data.gov.uk%2Fid%2Fregion%2Funited-kingdom&to=2020-12-01&lang=en,https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uk-house-price-index-summary-june-2020/uk-house-price-index-summary-june-2020,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/about-the-uk-house-price-index/about-the-uk-house-price-index#monthly-revision,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddisposableincomeandinequality/financialyearending2020provisional,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddisposableincomeandinequality/financialyearending2020provisional#analysis-of-average-income,https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/datasets/householddisposableincomeandinequality,https://fullfact.org/online/bill-gates-has-not-bought-telegram/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/photo-of-mike-tyson-in-plan-demic-t-shirt-has-been-edited/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/lorraine-kelly-himalayas/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/no-evidence-rapper-dmx-had-covid-19-vaccine-his-death/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content,https://fullfact.org/online/priti-patel-eyebrows-ppe/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content",House price growth has outstripped income growth—but not by much,,,,,,

It presents a checklist of claims about the vaccine, alongside ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ answers. Some of the claims are inaccurate and suggest the mRNA vaccines may be dangerous. The Covid-19 vaccines have been tested to the same high standards as any vaccine would be. While side effects are common, these are overwhelmingly minor and pass within a few days.   While these are the first mRNA vaccines to be rolled out to the general public, the technology behind mRNA vaccines has been developed over a number of years.   In the UK, two of the three approved Covid-19 vaccines , the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine - use mRNA technology.  Both mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would. Many vaccines work by introducing a weakened or inactive virus or bacteria into the body which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies in response. These antibodies then protect the body if it comes into contact with the real thing. Covid-19 mRNA vaccines go one step back in the process. Once inside the body, the mRNA works to build the spike proteins on the surface of the Covid-19 virus. The body then responds by producing antibodies which attack those proteins.This means that if it is later infected, the body will be able to generate a faster and more effective immune response to the virus. This is untrue. The Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have all been tested on animals. The Associated Press reports this confusion may have arisen because Moderna and Pfizer were given permission to test their vaccines on human trial participants concurrently with animal tests. Ordinarily animal tests are done before human trials.  “Have they been subject to medium or long term safety testing on humans? No” This depends on how you define medium or long term. The vaccines have been trialled on humans since mid-2020, so we do have over six months of safety data for each vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna have said they will continue monitoring their trialists for safety. It’s unclear what’s meant by “reversible”.  All the vaccines are intended to protect people against Covid-19. It is unclear how long that protection will last, and so in that sense the effects of the vaccines may wear off over time. The vaccines can cause side effects but the vast majority of these, such as pain around the injection site, fatigue or nausea, are mild and pass within a few days.  The evidence suggesting vaccinations can cause more serious side effects resulting in permanent damage is far more limited. For example in the Pfizer trial, the proportion of people who experienced a serious “adverse event” after vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine was 0.6% and among the group of people who received the placebo it was 0.5%. Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. These reports are then investigated to determine whether there is any link to the vaccines. All the vaccines available significantly reduce the risk of developing Covid-19. Looking specifically at the mRNA vaccines, on clinical trials, participants who had received the Moderna vaccine were 94% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo, and none developed “severe Covid”. Recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 95% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo. In real-world data from Israel, recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 94% less likely to develop symptomatic Covid-19 and 92% less likely to contract “severe Covid”. Emerging evidence suggests the vaccines also stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19, as well as stopping those infections turning into symptomatic illnesses. For example, a recent Scottish study, which hasn’t been peer reviewed yet, found that the rate of infection among people who live with healthcare workers was at least 30% lower when the worker had been vaccinated.  Public Health Scotland (PHS) said: “Since household members of healthcare workers can also be infected via other people (not just via the healthcare worker they live with), this 30% relative risk reduction is an underestimate of the ‘true’ effect of vaccination on transmission.” But Dr Diane Stockton, PHS Lead for COVID-19 Vaccination Surveillance Programme, also said: ""Despite this good news, it is important to remember that infection prevention and control practices in healthcare settings remain of paramount importance, as do the mitigations to prevent spread in our daily lives.  “The risk of transmission did not go down to zero after the healthcare worker was vaccinated.” Current UK government guidelines still require vaccinated people to follow the same rules as unvaccinated people when it comes to wearing a mask. Some of the vaccines do contain GMOs. For example, the AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a virus, which carries the genetic instructions for producing the coronavirus spike protein into human cells, without replicating itself and infecting the body.   Some vaccines use a virus as the active ingredient. As mentioned, for example, the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine uses a virus. Viruses need cells to replicate, so vaccine manufacturers use cells to manufacture enough of the virus for their vaccines. For example, the influenza vaccine is often made using chicken eggs. For the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, the virus is replicated using modified copies of cells taken from an aborted foetus in the 1970s. This cell line is called HEK-293 and we’ve written about it before.  The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a different virus grown in cells taken from an aborted foetus in 1985. So both vaccines are produced using copies of copies of these cells, rather than the original foetal cells themselves. And while the cells are used to grow the virus, they are filtered out of the vaccine, meaning neither vaccine “contain[s] aborted human...cells.” It’s unclear where the reference to monkey cells comes from, but it may be a misinterpretation of the fact that the virus used in the AstraZeneca vaccine is an altered version of a virus that typically infects chimpanzees. This doesn’t mean it comes from chimpanzees. There is no evidence that mRNA vaccines would impact fertility, but until more research is done to confirm they are safe for pregnant women, the NHS is currently recommending most pregnant women do not receive any Covid-19 vaccine. It says pregnant women with pre-existing conditions who might be at risk of developing severe complications should they contract the illness, and women who are at high risk of contracting the disease due to where they work, may still be able to get the vaccination. The reason why there has been concern is because the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bears a slight resemblance to proteins in the placenta. The theory being that if the vaccine leads to the body producing antibodies which attack the virus, those antibodies might also attack the placenta. But as we’ve said the resemblance is only slight and realistically the body is not likely to confuse the two.  If this was the case, then Covid-19 infection itself would also lead to fertility problems, and this had not been observed.

This means that vaccine manufacturers are free from some types of liability. However manufacturers aren’t fully protected. For example, the UK government says that manufacturers will still be liable if their vaccines do not meet safety standards or are “defective”. Some doctors and scientists are recommending people not to take Covid-19 vaccines.  Far more doctors, health professionals and public health bodies are recommending the vaccine and they have been found to be safe and effective.","https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=5981728828519227&set=bc.AbpoAbZiR1PeLrJnW1c3EFLulbBitWjrsPPpDLjMVFHze9sPmr3PoOWqYXUsaCng8wcJFpVlouoyNo7kZYglVBC0tsrmJS-prEOkBKPLqIiefaBfxXutHifU1GieL9JIeOXSrR-Eok_kv4MoNm2P0Wja&opaqueCursor=AboUl8o6HUrXCWqWdBijLgBvnmN3XYXOTKBPTZM1FuYgJZ_bfCdZnxo2MWxiqgjMRI7ZG30bsRfF1wsj583hodOgRXkECzxDKUXWItQ-ZM7ZSGiDVYU8co-8_ydw-Hj4THOecNwdt6rIRIDfuWyT5um4UGPf0CyN_8_82-vsDkAd7YNsVkBZ5qKmolBA7wryryNLgs1qO8_NeHwn7J-OmJEb77v5aPAniqh5QmOAnJQtzQqFgD2EG_4knL6r5gG3gkyvqOjwrKRAsfY1--xFsOFlxI_8iplG5ssKeQRdOA47tebWxdf8BE0Jt8BsXm2PN-H3NRXkwOzTQW569UZuZ48lyNMdRxjrpVQrIVxm2MfK5gmfATTpI9j0we452lIapW0TRl5Uy14fUh2CicX77BxCkE6Pk4FVt0E75R68Gqyr_iWxyyBrC7FHjlvOGuoeBNB4-vaOdHHmkpQf2OkJIVtGnvX0A9nxT3390GZYFEDHXUquPj-IxC3gR9tq0WUpxAa2v6qJG_MtAiZ3fuJ4SS5dPOJpe9gxrRYmUT8FVZ_Hq2zDdMPUFNCD5dQh27R6L0pGk9O0ay6Xk2LH7sanOxL1pTKMU-1m4GZmvtKYdLM2Rjpj1LBnWYuDuMal_ejBP80nYDWQb7EaHRo_EES_7HvBo1ZSYWWSAmnE38XbUf-WGw,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/m49knw/covid_vaccine_fact_check/,https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10158701999071091&set=bc.AbrYidGtX1k-JZV1ajOzVLuCAbulby9lyBqV27FiTNTpAovOvo6xYZnlQE_dJJWTXfvWQKOZGcbrJ47K9kJEM-rPc2Xox8UEJYWLIEDmZerSwkCb3O97QBwWGg0yaVgSdehJ4DmN73zp-_a_U3gfAg1U&opaqueCursor=AbrNbQJ-9Qke1CKgZQG68fg7VkdgUiPQgEVfOPG2IBT7oGwms1kbh9eMMlLyDcNh697SzXRIyRjUTMBq-Bsm7dImzGqJ7sr2Hwhc_LpWrnbaMaqfjeF835_Lu4Z4PMlcmwl6OwDxiFdnnrGKMfYqS5zxutGPRmYSNbNCfdOC5j3ogDzWW-p5Jhjj_bIr9b-eCb8Lu4FkDAC-j0Rl9ZqG20o5KYWaY2EazXteZe8bSxGvg6kclyLaSUZJz2QBAkNSMaS7h4lDnaHRZrUw5NbFJ9xHFtCTO3TjKbw1h5cVEX6WJlErmW8V56A6aZFnKeV1lJfMu2K8rwAV6mZ7DlMA0bXGCACZfoltnxjk5x-_krM_Hr7C2qCgcgbdw17JvvQ8j3BSYAD9lwOE4LLyIsG18pVrIYYk3pLFkmD_j9aBUiVHmUEp5Vym3BqLqHg3QW98jc_pujWakoBJVOgh1tGhi6H37tNY1SjZlU8CxbjXdRpcIuIvaN39ZK4SO9gWAyzsB-BYpisy7KJoN71rhZeuCRowIo9uDF9-rBEbHtCTe0-xynmf2b8MsNDVEMYeXWCXjKWjynvZ14G2F9xLw28Sdkha6-kjR7GVviBn0dm4cfNqLVs5--ZJe3TbmU5HcuJDtRKD8udR0lgD_M-czADlWs4X,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html,https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/covid-19-vaccines,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna/information-for-uk-recipients-on-covid-19-vaccine-moderna,https://fullfact.org/online/war-criminals-covid/,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01092-3,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-data-preclinical-studies-mrna,https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/oxford-university-covid-19-vaccine-monkey-data/,https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-afs:Content:9792931264,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577,https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-publication-results-pivotal-phase-3-trial,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html,https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/reactogenicity.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fcovid-19%2Finfo-by-manufacturer%2Fpfizer%2Freactogenicity.html,https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-covid-19-vaccine-moderna,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine#date-of-first-authorisationrenewal-of-the-authorisation,https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n567?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=4b3432fe35dc0a2d7b37ab2e0499c9ee4d496468-1616598165-0-ARMFj9rjs9PZAkyNGoC2knts_1s0pLWYEWIc_GCHqmvIJ9hFqKlE-2meD2RbxF-NYpnfPN_noz-nr5rvsjUWQz8W2SsvoGeaPd-KTM-m0P9BKvU4n_Tc3tO64zRmlFDKXknYtfE55jJYVITw86l-O2K9aCs_R2SmOPz2TIuJCuScUgzBxKSU7HxSHbp39MGvU179fnG_aA1cwEuv7__yuFT3wv7624zhGQbJ56xpqgpizWheAFH-4glRSL4kNVk80Npmdyewt9Ly1M0dkC5xCTiZDvO9yTpTeZyL5WuljjBKbj7Oo4bn0n_Ktx4ZlM6raRVDy84XFlDPQmOBex-Wy7pecQlCjaSjIkhPp5s-jtva,https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n567?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=4b3432fe35dc0a2d7b37ab2e0499c9ee4d496468-1616598165-0-ARMFj9rjs9PZAkyNGoC2knts_1s0pLWYEWIc_GCHqmvIJ9hFqKlE-2meD2RbxF-NYpnfPN_noz-nr5rvsjUWQz8W2SsvoGeaPd-KTM-m0P9BKvU4n_Tc3tO64zRmlFDKXknYtfE55jJYVITw86l-O2K9aCs_R2SmOPz2TIuJCuScUgzBxKSU7HxSHbp39MGvU179fnG_aA1cwEuv7__yuFT3wv7624zhGQbJ56xpqgpizWheAFH-4glRSL4kNVk80Npmdyewt9Ly1M0dkC5xCTiZDvO9yTpTeZyL5WuljjBKbj7Oo4bn0n_Ktx4ZlM6raRVDy84XFlDPQmOBex-Wy7pecQlCjaSjIkhPp5s-jtva,https://www.publichealthscotland.scot/news/2021/march/covid-19-vaccine-linked-to-a-reduction-in-transmission/,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-what-to-expect-after-vaccination/what-to-expect-after-your-covid-19-vaccination#can-you-give-covid-19-to-anyone-if-you-have-had-the-vaccine,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wea

Covid vaccine ‘Q&A’: fact checked,,,,,,
32,,,,True,Abbas Panjwani,2021-03-25,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,Vaccine manufacturers are not liable for injuries or deaths caused by the vaccines.,2021-03-25,fullfact,,"A Covid-19 vaccine “Q&A” sheet has been circulating on social media. It presents a checklist of claims about the vaccine, alongside ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ answers. Some of the claims are inaccurate and suggest the mRNA vaccines may be dangerous. The Covid-19 vaccines have been tested to the same high standards as any vaccine would be. While side effects are common, these are overwhelmingly minor and pass within a few days.   While these are the first mRNA vaccines to be rolled out to the general public, the technology behind mRNA vaccines has been developed over a number of years.   In the UK, two of the three approved Covid-19 vaccines , the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine - use mRNA technology.  Both mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would. Many vaccines work by introducing a weakened or inactive virus or bacteria into the body which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies in response. These antibodies then protect the body if it comes into contact with the real thing. Covid-19 mRNA vaccines go one step back in the process. Once inside the body, the mRNA works to build the spike proteins on the surface of the Covid-19 virus. The body then responds by producing antibodies which attack those proteins.This means that if it is later infected, the body will be able to generate a faster and more effective immune response to the virus. This is untrue. The Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have all been tested on animals. The Associated Press reports this confusion may have arisen because Moderna and Pfizer were given permission to test their vaccines on human trial participants concurrently with animal tests. Ordinarily animal tests are done before human trials.  “Have they been subject to medium or long term safety testing on humans? No” This depends on how you define medium or long term. The vaccines have been trialled on humans since mid-2020, so we do have over six months of safety data for each vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna have said they will continue monitoring their trialists for safety. It’s unclear what’s meant by “reversible”.  All the vaccines are intended to protect people against Covid-19. It is unclear how long that protection will last, and so in that sense the effects of the vaccines may wear off over time. The vaccines can cause side effects but the vast majority of these, such as pain around the injection site, fatigue or nausea, are mild and pass within a few days.  The evidence suggesting vaccinations can cause more serious side effects resulting in permanent damage is far more limited. For example in the Pfizer trial, the proportion of people who experienced a serious “adverse event” after vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine was 0.6% and among the group of people who received the placebo it was 0.5%. Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. These reports are then investigated to determine whether there is any link to the vaccines. All the vaccines available significantly reduce the risk of developing Covid-19. Looking specifically at the mRNA vaccines, on clinical trials, participants who had received the Moderna vaccine were 94% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo, and none developed “severe Covid”. Recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 95% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo. In real-world data from Israel, recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 94% less likely to develop symptomatic Covid-19 and 92% less likely to contract “severe Covid”. Emerging evidence suggests the vaccines also stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19, as well as stopping those infections turning into symptomatic illnesses. For example, a recent Scottish study, which hasn’t been peer reviewed yet, found that the rate of infection among people who live with healthcare workers was at least 30% lower when the worker had been vaccinated.  Public Health Scotland (PHS) said: “Since household members of healthcare workers can also be infected via other people (not just via the healthcare worker they live with), this 30% relative risk reduction is an underestimate of the ‘true’ effect of vaccination on transmission.” But Dr Diane Stockton, PHS Lead for COVID-19 Vaccination Surveillance Programme, also said: ""Despite this good news, it is important to remember that infection prevention and control practices in healthcare settings remain of paramount importance, as do the mitigations to prevent spread in our daily lives.  “The risk of transmission did not go down to zero after the healthcare worker was vaccinated.” Current UK government guidelines still require vaccinated people to follow the same rules as unvaccinated people when it comes to wearing a mask. Some of the vaccines do contain GMOs. For example, the AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a virus, which carries the genetic instructions for producing the coronavirus spike protein into human cells, without replicating itself and infecting the body.   Some vaccines use a virus as the active ingredient. As mentioned, for example, the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine uses a virus. Viruses need cells to replicate, so vaccine manufacturers use cells to manufacture enough of the virus for their vaccines. For example, the influenza vaccine is often made using chicken eggs. For the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, the virus is replicated using modified copies of cells taken from an aborted foetus in the 1970s. This cell line is called HEK-293 and we’ve written about it before.  The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a different virus grown in cells taken from an aborted foetus in 1985. So both vaccines are produced using copies of copies of these cells, rather than the original foetal cells themselves. And while the cells are used to grow the virus, they are filtered out of the vaccine, meaning neither vaccine “contain[s] aborted human...cells.” It’s unclear where the reference to monkey cells comes from, but it may be a misinterpretation of the fact that the virus used in the AstraZeneca vaccine is an altered version of a virus that typically infects chimpanzees. This doesn’t mean it comes from chimpanzees. There is no evidence that mRNA vaccines would impact fertility, but until more research is done to confirm they are safe for pregnant women, the NHS is currently recommending most pregnant women do not receive any Covid-19 vaccine. It says pregnant women with pre-existing conditions who might be at risk of developing severe complications should they contract the illness, and women who are at high risk of contracting the disease due to where they work, may still be able to get the vaccination. The reason why there has been concern is because the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bears a slight resemblance to proteins in the placenta. The theory being that if the vaccine leads to the body producing antibodies which attack the virus, those antibodies might also attack the placenta. But as we’ve said the resemblance is only slight and realistically the body is not likely to confuse the two.  If this was the case, then Covid-19 infection itself would also lead to fertility problems, and this had not been observed. We’ve written about this before.  As mentioned, many people may experience side effects with Covid-19 vaccines but these are overwhelmingly mild and pass within a few days.  Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. As we’ve said, these are then investigated to determine whether the vaccine was the cause or not. In the US there is a similar system for reporting suspected side effects called VAERS.  We’ve written more about claims linking vaccinations and specific side effects. No deaths have been directly attributed to Covid-19 vaccinations. As mentioned, in the UK, deaths and side effects can be reported to the Yellow Card scheme for investigation. As of 14 March, none of the deaths reported were found to be caused by vaccinations. By contrast, Covid-19 itself is estimated to kill around 0.5-1% of people who are infected in countries with similar age profiles and healthcare to the UK.  In the UK the vaccines have gone through all the normal safety checks and received temporary authorisation to be rolled out, but they have not been fully “licensed”. This means that vaccine manufacturers are free from some types of liability. However manufacturers aren’t fully protected. For example, the UK government says that manufacturers will still be liable if their vaccines do not meet safety standards or are “defective”. Some doctors and scientists are recommending people not to take Covid-19 vaccines.  Far more doctors, health professionals and public health bodies are recommending the vaccine and they have been

Covid vaccine ‘Q&A’: fact checked,,,,,,
33,,,,True,Abbas Panjwani,2021-03-25,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,Vaccine manufacturers are not liable for injuries or deaths caused by the vaccines.,2021-03-25,fullfact,,"A Covid-19 vaccine “Q&A” sheet has been circulating on social media. It presents a checklist of claims about the vaccine, alongside ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ answers. Some of the claims are inaccurate and suggest the mRNA vaccines may be dangerous. The Covid-19 vaccines have been tested to the same high standards as any vaccine would be. While side effects are common, these are overwhelmingly minor and pass within a few days.   While these are the first mRNA vaccines to be rolled out to the general public, the technology behind mRNA vaccines has been developed over a number of years.   In the UK, two of the three approved Covid-19 vaccines , the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine - use mRNA technology.  Both mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would. Many vaccines work by introducing a weakened or inactive virus or bacteria into the body which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies in response. These antibodies then protect the body if it comes into contact with the real thing. Covid-19 mRNA vaccines go one step back in the process. Once inside the body, the mRNA works to build the spike proteins on the surface of the Covid-19 virus. The body then responds by producing antibodies which attack those proteins.This means that if it is later infected, the body will be able to generate a faster and more effective immune response to the virus. This is untrue. The Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have all been tested on animals. The Associated Press reports this confusion may have arisen because Moderna and Pfizer were given permission to test their vaccines on human trial participants concurrently with animal tests. Ordinarily animal tests are done before human trials.  “Have they been subject to medium or long term safety testing on humans? No” This depends on how you define medium or long term. The vaccines have been trialled on humans since mid-2020, so we do have over six months of safety data for each vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna have said they will continue monitoring their trialists for safety. It’s unclear what’s meant by “reversible”.  All the vaccines are intended to protect people against Covid-19. It is unclear how long that protection will last, and so in that sense the effects of the vaccines may wear off over time. The vaccines can cause side effects but the vast majority of these, such as pain around the injection site, fatigue or nausea, are mild and pass within a few days.  The evidence suggesting vaccinations can cause more serious side effects resulting in permanent damage is far more limited. For example in the Pfizer trial, the proportion of people who experienced a serious “adverse event” after vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine was 0.6% and among the group of people who received the placebo it was 0.5%. Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. These reports are then investigated to determine whether there is any link to the vaccines. All the vaccines available significantly reduce the risk of developing Covid-19. Looking specifically at the mRNA vaccines, on clinical trials, participants who had received the Moderna vaccine were 94% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo, and none developed “severe Covid”. Recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 95% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo. In real-world data from Israel, recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 94% less likely to develop symptomatic Covid-19 and 92% less likely to contract “severe Covid”. Emerging evidence suggests the vaccines also stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19, as well as stopping those infections turning into symptomatic illnesses. For example, a recent Scottish study, which hasn’t been peer reviewed yet, found that the rate of infection among people who live with healthcare workers was at least 30% lower when the worker had been vaccinated.  Public Health Scotland (PHS) said: “Since household members of healthcare workers can also be infected via other people (not just via the healthcare worker they live with), this 30% relative risk reduction is an underestimate of the ‘true’ effect of vaccination on transmission.” But Dr Diane Stockton, PHS Lead for COVID-19 Vaccination Surveillance Programme, also said: ""Despite this good news, it is important to remember that infection prevention and control practices in healthcare settings remain of paramount importance, as do the mitigations to prevent spread in our daily lives.  “The risk of transmission did not go down to zero after the healthcare worker was vaccinated.” Current UK government guidelines still require vaccinated people to follow the same rules as unvaccinated people when it comes to wearing a mask. Some of the vaccines do contain GMOs. For example, the AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a virus, which carries the genetic instructions for producing the coronavirus spike protein into human cells, without replicating itself and infecting the body.   Some vaccines use a virus as the active ingredient. As mentioned, for example, the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine uses a virus. Viruses need cells to replicate, so vaccine manufacturers use cells to manufacture enough of the virus for their vaccines. For example, the influenza vaccine is often made using chicken eggs. For the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, the virus is replicated using modified copies of cells taken from an aborted foetus in the 1970s. This cell line is called HEK-293 and we’ve written about it before.  The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a different virus grown in cells taken from an aborted foetus in 1985. So both vaccines are produced using copies of copies of these cells, rather than the original foetal cells themselves. And while the cells are used to grow the virus, they are filtered out of the vaccine, meaning neither vaccine “contain[s] aborted human...cells.” It’s unclear where the reference to monkey cells comes from, but it may be a misinterpretation of the fact that the virus used in the AstraZeneca vaccine is an altered version of a virus that typically infects chimpanzees. This doesn’t mean it comes from chimpanzees. There is no evidence that mRNA vaccines would impact fertility, but until more research is done to confirm they are safe for pregnant women, the NHS is currently recommending most pregnant women do not receive any Covid-19 vaccine. It says pregnant women with pre-existing conditions who might be at risk of developing severe complications should they contract the illness, and women who are at high risk of contracting the disease due to where they work, may still be able to get the vaccination. The reason why there has been concern is because the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bears a slight resemblance to proteins in the placenta. The theory being that if the vaccine leads to the body producing antibodies which attack the virus, those antibodies might also attack the placenta. But as we’ve said the resemblance is only slight and realistically the body is not likely to confuse the two.  If this was the case, then Covid-19 infection itself would also lead to fertility problems, and this had not been observed. We’ve written about this before.  As mentioned, many people may experience side effects with Covid-19 vaccines but these are overwhelmingly mild and pass within a few days.  Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. As we’ve said, these are then investigated to determine whether the vaccine was the cause or not. In the US there is a similar system for reporting suspected side effects called VAERS.  We’ve written more about claims linking vaccinations and specific side effects. No deaths have been directly attributed to Covid-19 vaccinations. As mentioned, in the UK, deaths and side effects can be reported to the Yellow Card scheme for investigation. As of 14 March, none of the deaths reported were found to be caused by vaccinations. By contrast, Covid-19 itself is estimated to kill around 0.5-1% of people who are infected in countries with similar age profiles and healthcare to the UK.  In the UK the vaccines have gone through all the normal safety checks and received temporary authorisation to be rolled out, but they have not been fully “licensed”. This means that vaccine manufacturers are free from some types of liability. However manufacturers aren’t fully protected. For example, the UK government says that manufacturers will still be liable if their vaccines do not meet safety standards or are “defective”. Some doctors and scientists are recommending people not to take Covid-19 vaccines.  Far more doctors, health professionals and public health bodies are recommending the vaccine and they have been

Covid vaccine ‘Q&A’: fact checked,,,,,,
34,,,,True,Abbas Panjwani,2021-03-25,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,Vaccine manufacturers are not liable for injuries or deaths caused by the vaccines.,2021-03-25,fullfact,,"A Covid-19 vaccine “Q&A” sheet has been circulating on social media. It presents a checklist of claims about the vaccine, alongside ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ answers. Some of the claims are inaccurate and suggest the mRNA vaccines may be dangerous. The Covid-19 vaccines have been tested to the same high standards as any vaccine would be. While side effects are common, these are overwhelmingly minor and pass within a few days.   While these are the first mRNA vaccines to be rolled out to the general public, the technology behind mRNA vaccines has been developed over a number of years.   In the UK, two of the three approved Covid-19 vaccines , the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine - use mRNA technology.  Both mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would. Many vaccines work by introducing a weakened or inactive virus or bacteria into the body which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies in response. These antibodies then protect the body if it comes into contact with the real thing. Covid-19 mRNA vaccines go one step back in the process. Once inside the body, the mRNA works to build the spike proteins on the surface of the Covid-19 virus. The body then responds by producing antibodies which attack those proteins.This means that if it is later infected, the body will be able to generate a faster and more effective immune response to the virus. This is untrue. The Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have all been tested on animals. The Associated Press reports this confusion may have arisen because Moderna and Pfizer were given permission to test their vaccines on human trial participants concurrently with animal tests. Ordinarily animal tests are done before human trials.  “Have they been subject to medium or long term safety testing on humans? No” This depends on how you define medium or long term. The vaccines have been trialled on humans since mid-2020, so we do have over six months of safety data for each vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna have said they will continue monitoring their trialists for safety. It’s unclear what’s meant by “reversible”.  All the vaccines are intended to protect people against Covid-19. It is unclear how long that protection will last, and so in that sense the effects of the vaccines may wear off over time. The vaccines can cause side effects but the vast majority of these, such as pain around the injection site, fatigue or nausea, are mild and pass within a few days.  The evidence suggesting vaccinations can cause more serious side effects resulting in permanent damage is far more limited. For example in the Pfizer trial, the proportion of people who experienced a serious “adverse event” after vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine was 0.6% and among the group of people who received the placebo it was 0.5%. Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. These reports are then investigated to determine whether there is any link to the vaccines. All the vaccines available significantly reduce the risk of developing Covid-19. Looking specifically at the mRNA vaccines, on clinical trials, participants who had received the Moderna vaccine were 94% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo, and none developed “severe Covid”. Recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 95% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo. In real-world data from Israel, recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 94% less likely to develop symptomatic Covid-19 and 92% less likely to contract “severe Covid”. Emerging evidence suggests the vaccines also stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19, as well as stopping those infections turning into symptomatic illnesses. For example, a recent Scottish study, which hasn’t been peer reviewed yet, found that the rate of infection among people who live with healthcare workers was at least 30% lower when the worker had been vaccinated.  Public Health Scotland (PHS) said: “Since household members of healthcare workers can also be infected via other people (not just via the healthcare worker they live with), this 30% relative risk reduction is an underestimate of the ‘true’ effect of vaccination on transmission.” But Dr Diane Stockton, PHS Lead for COVID-19 Vaccination Surveillance Programme, also said: ""Despite this good news, it is important to remember that infection prevention and control practices in healthcare settings remain of paramount importance, as do the mitigations to prevent spread in our daily lives.  “The risk of transmission did not go down to zero after the healthcare worker was vaccinated.” Current UK government guidelines still require vaccinated people to follow the same rules as unvaccinated people when it comes to wearing a mask. Some of the vaccines do contain GMOs. For example, the AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a virus, which carries the genetic instructions for producing the coronavirus spike protein into human cells, without replicating itself and infecting the body.   Some vaccines use a virus as the active ingredient. As mentioned, for example, the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine uses a virus. Viruses need cells to replicate, so vaccine manufacturers use cells to manufacture enough of the virus for their vaccines. For example, the influenza vaccine is often made using chicken eggs. For the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, the virus is replicated using modified copies of cells taken from an aborted foetus in the 1970s. This cell line is called HEK-293 and we’ve written about it before.  The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a different virus grown in cells taken from an aborted foetus in 1985. So both vaccines are produced using copies of copies of these cells, rather than the original foetal cells themselves. And while the cells are used to grow the virus, they are filtered out of the vaccine, meaning neither vaccine “contain[s] aborted human...cells.” It’s unclear where the reference to monkey cells comes from, but it may be a misinterpretation of the fact that the virus used in the AstraZeneca vaccine is an altered version of a virus that typically infects chimpanzees. This doesn’t mean it comes from chimpanzees. There is no evidence that mRNA vaccines would impact fertility, but until more research is done to confirm they are safe for pregnant women, the NHS is currently recommending most pregnant women do not receive any Covid-19 vaccine. It says pregnant women with pre-existing conditions who might be at risk of developing severe complications should they contract the illness, and women who are at high risk of contracting the disease due to where they work, may still be able to get the vaccination. The reason why there has been concern is because the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bears a slight resemblance to proteins in the placenta. The theory being that if the vaccine leads to the body producing antibodies which attack the virus, those antibodies might also attack the placenta. But as we’ve said the resemblance is only slight and realistically the body is not likely to confuse the two.  If this was the case, then Covid-19 infection itself would also lead to fertility problems, and this had not been observed. We’ve written about this before.  As mentioned, many people may experience side effects with Covid-19 vaccines but these are overwhelmingly mild and pass within a few days.  Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. As we’ve said, these are then investigated to determine whether the vaccine was the cause or not. In the US there is a similar system for reporting suspected side effects called VAERS.  We’ve written more about claims linking vaccinations and specific side effects. No deaths have been directly attributed to Covid-19 vaccinations. As mentioned, in the UK, deaths and side effects can be reported to the Yellow Card scheme for investigation. As of 14 March, none of the deaths reported were found to be caused by vaccinations. By contrast, Covid-19 itself is estimated to kill around 0.5-1% of people who are infected in countries with similar age profiles and healthcare to the UK.  In the UK the vaccines have gone through all the normal safety checks and received temporary authorisation to be rolled out, but they have not been fully “licensed”. This means that vaccine manufacturers are free from some types of liability. However manufacturers aren’t fully protected. For example, the UK government says that manufacturers will still be liable if their vaccines do not meet safety standards or are “defective”. Some doctors and scientists are recommending people not to take Covid-19 vaccines.  Far more doctors, health professionals and public health bodies are recommending the vaccine and they have been

Covid vaccine ‘Q&A’: fact checked,,,,,,
35,,,,True,Abbas Panjwani,2021-03-25,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,Vaccine manufacturers are not liable for injuries or deaths caused by the vaccines.,2021-03-25,fullfact,,"A Covid-19 vaccine “Q&A” sheet has been circulating on social media. It presents a checklist of claims about the vaccine, alongside ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ answers. Some of the claims are inaccurate and suggest the mRNA vaccines may be dangerous. The Covid-19 vaccines have been tested to the same high standards as any vaccine would be. While side effects are common, these are overwhelmingly minor and pass within a few days.   While these are the first mRNA vaccines to be rolled out to the general public, the technology behind mRNA vaccines has been developed over a number of years.   In the UK, two of the three approved Covid-19 vaccines , the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine - use mRNA technology.  Both mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would. Many vaccines work by introducing a weakened or inactive virus or bacteria into the body which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies in response. These antibodies then protect the body if it comes into contact with the real thing. Covid-19 mRNA vaccines go one step back in the process. Once inside the body, the mRNA works to build the spike proteins on the surface of the Covid-19 virus. The body then responds by producing antibodies which attack those proteins.This means that if it is later infected, the body will be able to generate a faster and more effective immune response to the virus. This is untrue. The Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have all been tested on animals. The Associated Press reports this confusion may have arisen because Moderna and Pfizer were given permission to test their vaccines on human trial participants concurrently with animal tests. Ordinarily animal tests are done before human trials.  “Have they been subject to medium or long term safety testing on humans? No” This depends on how you define medium or long term. The vaccines have been trialled on humans since mid-2020, so we do have over six months of safety data for each vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna have said they will continue monitoring their trialists for safety. It’s unclear what’s meant by “reversible”.  All the vaccines are intended to protect people against Covid-19. It is unclear how long that protection will last, and so in that sense the effects of the vaccines may wear off over time. The vaccines can cause side effects but the vast majority of these, such as pain around the injection site, fatigue or nausea, are mild and pass within a few days.  The evidence suggesting vaccinations can cause more serious side effects resulting in permanent damage is far more limited. For example in the Pfizer trial, the proportion of people who experienced a serious “adverse event” after vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine was 0.6% and among the group of people who received the placebo it was 0.5%. Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. These reports are then investigated to determine whether there is any link to the vaccines. All the vaccines available significantly reduce the risk of developing Covid-19. Looking specifically at the mRNA vaccines, on clinical trials, participants who had received the Moderna vaccine were 94% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo, and none developed “severe Covid”. Recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 95% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo. In real-world data from Israel, recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 94% less likely to develop symptomatic Covid-19 and 92% less likely to contract “severe Covid”. Emerging evidence suggests the vaccines also stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19, as well as stopping those infections turning into symptomatic illnesses. For example, a recent Scottish study, which hasn’t been peer reviewed yet, found that the rate of infection among people who live with healthcare workers was at least 30% lower when the worker had been vaccinated.  Public Health Scotland (PHS) said: “Since household members of healthcare workers can also be infected via other people (not just via the healthcare worker they live with), this 30% relative risk reduction is an underestimate of the ‘true’ effect of vaccination on transmission.” But Dr Diane Stockton, PHS Lead for COVID-19 Vaccination Surveillance Programme, also said: ""Despite this good news, it is important to remember that infection prevention and control practices in healthcare settings remain of paramount importance, as do the mitigations to prevent spread in our daily lives.  “The risk of transmission did not go down to zero after the healthcare worker was vaccinated.” Current UK government guidelines still require vaccinated people to follow the same rules as unvaccinated people when it comes to wearing a mask. Some of the vaccines do contain GMOs. For example, the AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a virus, which carries the genetic instructions for producing the coronavirus spike protein into human cells, without replicating itself and infecting the body.   Some vaccines use a virus as the active ingredient. As mentioned, for example, the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine uses a virus. Viruses need cells to replicate, so vaccine manufacturers use cells to manufacture enough of the virus for their vaccines. For example, the influenza vaccine is often made using chicken eggs. For the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, the virus is replicated using modified copies of cells taken from an aborted foetus in the 1970s. This cell line is called HEK-293 and we’ve written about it before.  The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a different virus grown in cells taken from an aborted foetus in 1985. So both vaccines are produced using copies of copies of these cells, rather than the original foetal cells themselves. And while the cells are used to grow the virus, they are filtered out of the vaccine, meaning neither vaccine “contain[s] aborted human...cells.” It’s unclear where the reference to monkey cells comes from, but it may be a misinterpretation of the fact that the virus used in the AstraZeneca vaccine is an altered version of a virus that typically infects chimpanzees. This doesn’t mean it comes from chimpanzees. There is no evidence that mRNA vaccines would impact fertility, but until more research is done to confirm they are safe for pregnant women, the NHS is currently recommending most pregnant women do not receive any Covid-19 vaccine. It says pregnant women with pre-existing conditions who might be at risk of developing severe complications should they contract the illness, and women who are at high risk of contracting the disease due to where they work, may still be able to get the vaccination. The reason why there has been concern is because the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bears a slight resemblance to proteins in the placenta. The theory being that if the vaccine leads to the body producing antibodies which attack the virus, those antibodies might also attack the placenta. But as we’ve said the resemblance is only slight and realistically the body is not likely to confuse the two.  If this was the case, then Covid-19 infection itself would also lead to fertility problems, and this had not been observed. We’ve written about this before.  As mentioned, many people may experience side effects with Covid-19 vaccines but these are overwhelmingly mild and pass within a few days.  Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. As we’ve said, these are then investigated to determine whether the vaccine was the cause or not. In the US there is a similar system for reporting suspected side effects called VAERS.  We’ve written more about claims linking vaccinations and specific side effects. No deaths have been directly attributed to Covid-19 vaccinations. As mentioned, in the UK, deaths and side effects can be reported to the Yellow Card scheme for investigation. As of 14 March, none of the deaths reported were found to be caused by vaccinations. By contrast, Covid-19 itself is estimated to kill around 0.5-1% of people who are infected in countries with similar age profiles and healthcare to the UK.  In the UK the vaccines have gone through all the normal safety checks and received temporary authorisation to be rolled out, but they have not been fully “licensed”. This means that vaccine manufacturers are free from some types of liability. However manufacturers aren’t fully protected. For example, the UK government says that manufacturers will still be liable if their vaccines do not meet safety standards or are “defective”. Some doctors and scientists are recommending people not to take Covid-19 vaccines.  Far more doctors, health professionals and public health bodies are recommending the vaccine and they have been

Covid vaccine ‘Q&A’: fact checked,,,,,,
36,,,,True,Abbas Panjwani,2021-03-25,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,Vaccine manufacturers are not liable for injuries or deaths caused by the vaccines.,2021-03-25,fullfact,,"A Covid-19 vaccine “Q&A” sheet has been circulating on social media. It presents a checklist of claims about the vaccine, alongside ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ answers. Some of the claims are inaccurate and suggest the mRNA vaccines may be dangerous. The Covid-19 vaccines have been tested to the same high standards as any vaccine would be. While side effects are common, these are overwhelmingly minor and pass within a few days.   While these are the first mRNA vaccines to be rolled out to the general public, the technology behind mRNA vaccines has been developed over a number of years.   In the UK, two of the three approved Covid-19 vaccines , the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine - use mRNA technology.  Both mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would. Many vaccines work by introducing a weakened or inactive virus or bacteria into the body which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies in response. These antibodies then protect the body if it comes into contact with the real thing. Covid-19 mRNA vaccines go one step back in the process. Once inside the body, the mRNA works to build the spike proteins on the surface of the Covid-19 virus. The body then responds by producing antibodies which attack those proteins.This means that if it is later infected, the body will be able to generate a faster and more effective immune response to the virus. This is untrue. The Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have all been tested on animals. The Associated Press reports this confusion may have arisen because Moderna and Pfizer were given permission to test their vaccines on human trial participants concurrently with animal tests. Ordinarily animal tests are done before human trials.  “Have they been subject to medium or long term safety testing on humans? No” This depends on how you define medium or long term. The vaccines have been trialled on humans since mid-2020, so we do have over six months of safety data for each vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna have said they will continue monitoring their trialists for safety. It’s unclear what’s meant by “reversible”.  All the vaccines are intended to protect people against Covid-19. It is unclear how long that protection will last, and so in that sense the effects of the vaccines may wear off over time. The vaccines can cause side effects but the vast majority of these, such as pain around the injection site, fatigue or nausea, are mild and pass within a few days.  The evidence suggesting vaccinations can cause more serious side effects resulting in permanent damage is far more limited. For example in the Pfizer trial, the proportion of people who experienced a serious “adverse event” after vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine was 0.6% and among the group of people who received the placebo it was 0.5%. Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. These reports are then investigated to determine whether there is any link to the vaccines. All the vaccines available significantly reduce the risk of developing Covid-19. Looking specifically at the mRNA vaccines, on clinical trials, participants who had received the Moderna vaccine were 94% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo, and none developed “severe Covid”. Recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 95% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo. In real-world data from Israel, recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 94% less likely to develop symptomatic Covid-19 and 92% less likely to contract “severe Covid”. Emerging evidence suggests the vaccines also stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19, as well as stopping those infections turning into symptomatic illnesses. For example, a recent Scottish study, which hasn’t been peer reviewed yet, found that the rate of infection among people who live with healthcare workers was at least 30% lower when the worker had been vaccinated.  Public Health Scotland (PHS) said: “Since household members of healthcare workers can also be infected via other people (not just via the healthcare worker they live with), this 30% relative risk reduction is an underestimate of the ‘true’ effect of vaccination on transmission.” But Dr Diane Stockton, PHS Lead for COVID-19 Vaccination Surveillance Programme, also said: ""Despite this good news, it is important to remember that infection prevention and control practices in healthcare settings remain of paramount importance, as do the mitigations to prevent spread in our daily lives.  “The risk of transmission did not go down to zero after the healthcare worker was vaccinated.” Current UK government guidelines still require vaccinated people to follow the same rules as unvaccinated people when it comes to wearing a mask. Some of the vaccines do contain GMOs. For example, the AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a virus, which carries the genetic instructions for producing the coronavirus spike protein into human cells, without replicating itself and infecting the body.   Some vaccines use a virus as the active ingredient. As mentioned, for example, the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine uses a virus. Viruses need cells to replicate, so vaccine manufacturers use cells to manufacture enough of the virus for their vaccines. For example, the influenza vaccine is often made using chicken eggs. For the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, the virus is replicated using modified copies of cells taken from an aborted foetus in the 1970s. This cell line is called HEK-293 and we’ve written about it before.  The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a different virus grown in cells taken from an aborted foetus in 1985. So both vaccines are produced using copies of copies of these cells, rather than the original foetal cells themselves. And while the cells are used to grow the virus, they are filtered out of the vaccine, meaning neither vaccine “contain[s] aborted human...cells.” It’s unclear where the reference to monkey cells comes from, but it may be a misinterpretation of the fact that the virus used in the AstraZeneca vaccine is an altered version of a virus that typically infects chimpanzees. This doesn’t mean it comes from chimpanzees. There is no evidence that mRNA vaccines would impact fertility, but until more research is done to confirm they are safe for pregnant women, the NHS is currently recommending most pregnant women do not receive any Covid-19 vaccine. It says pregnant women with pre-existing conditions who might be at risk of developing severe complications should they contract the illness, and women who are at high risk of contracting the disease due to where they work, may still be able to get the vaccination. The reason why there has been concern is because the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bears a slight resemblance to proteins in the placenta. The theory being that if the vaccine leads to the body producing antibodies which attack the virus, those antibodies might also attack the placenta. But as we’ve said the resemblance is only slight and realistically the body is not likely to confuse the two.  If this was the case, then Covid-19 infection itself would also lead to fertility problems, and this had not been observed. We’ve written about this before.  As mentioned, many people may experience side effects with Covid-19 vaccines but these are overwhelmingly mild and pass within a few days.  Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. As we’ve said, these are then investigated to determine whether the vaccine was the cause or not. In the US there is a similar system for reporting suspected side effects called VAERS.  We’ve written more about claims linking vaccinations and specific side effects. No deaths have been directly attributed to Covid-19 vaccinations. As mentioned, in the UK, deaths and side effects can be reported to the Yellow Card scheme for investigation. As of 14 March, none of the deaths reported were found to be caused by vaccinations. By contrast, Covid-19 itself is estimated to kill around 0.5-1% of people who are infected in countries with similar age profiles and healthcare to the UK.  In the UK the vaccines have gone through all the normal safety checks and received temporary authorisation to be rolled out, but they have not been fully “licensed”. This means that vaccine manufacturers are free from some types of liability. However manufacturers aren’t fully protected. For example, the UK government says that manufacturers will still be liable if their vaccines do not meet safety standards or are “defective”. Some doctors and scientists are recommending people not to take Covid-19 vaccines.  Far more doctors, health professionals and public health bodies are recommending the vaccine and they have been

Covid vaccine ‘Q&A’: fact checked,,,,,,
37,,,,True,Abbas Panjwani,2021-03-25,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,Vaccine manufacturers are not liable for injuries or deaths caused by the vaccines.,2021-03-25,fullfact,,"A Covid-19 vaccine “Q&A” sheet has been circulating on social media. It presents a checklist of claims about the vaccine, alongside ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ answers. Some of the claims are inaccurate and suggest the mRNA vaccines may be dangerous. The Covid-19 vaccines have been tested to the same high standards as any vaccine would be. While side effects are common, these are overwhelmingly minor and pass within a few days.   While these are the first mRNA vaccines to be rolled out to the general public, the technology behind mRNA vaccines has been developed over a number of years.   In the UK, two of the three approved Covid-19 vaccines , the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine - use mRNA technology.  Both mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would. Many vaccines work by introducing a weakened or inactive virus or bacteria into the body which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies in response. These antibodies then protect the body if it comes into contact with the real thing. Covid-19 mRNA vaccines go one step back in the process. Once inside the body, the mRNA works to build the spike proteins on the surface of the Covid-19 virus. The body then responds by producing antibodies which attack those proteins.This means that if it is later infected, the body will be able to generate a faster and more effective immune response to the virus. This is untrue. The Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have all been tested on animals. The Associated Press reports this confusion may have arisen because Moderna and Pfizer were given permission to test their vaccines on human trial participants concurrently with animal tests. Ordinarily animal tests are done before human trials.  “Have they been subject to medium or long term safety testing on humans? No” This depends on how you define medium or long term. The vaccines have been trialled on humans since mid-2020, so we do have over six months of safety data for each vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna have said they will continue monitoring their trialists for safety. It’s unclear what’s meant by “reversible”.  All the vaccines are intended to protect people against Covid-19. It is unclear how long that protection will last, and so in that sense the effects of the vaccines may wear off over time. The vaccines can cause side effects but the vast majority of these, such as pain around the injection site, fatigue or nausea, are mild and pass within a few days.  The evidence suggesting vaccinations can cause more serious side effects resulting in permanent damage is far more limited. For example in the Pfizer trial, the proportion of people who experienced a serious “adverse event” after vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine was 0.6% and among the group of people who received the placebo it was 0.5%. Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. These reports are then investigated to determine whether there is any link to the vaccines. All the vaccines available significantly reduce the risk of developing Covid-19. Looking specifically at the mRNA vaccines, on clinical trials, participants who had received the Moderna vaccine were 94% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo, and none developed “severe Covid”. Recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 95% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo. In real-world data from Israel, recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 94% less likely to develop symptomatic Covid-19 and 92% less likely to contract “severe Covid”. Emerging evidence suggests the vaccines also stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19, as well as stopping those infections turning into symptomatic illnesses. For example, a recent Scottish study, which hasn’t been peer reviewed yet, found that the rate of infection among people who live with healthcare workers was at least 30% lower when the worker had been vaccinated.  Public Health Scotland (PHS) said: “Since household members of healthcare workers can also be infected via other people (not just via the healthcare worker they live with), this 30% relative risk reduction is an underestimate of the ‘true’ effect of vaccination on transmission.” But Dr Diane Stockton, PHS Lead for COVID-19 Vaccination Surveillance Programme, also said: ""Despite this good news, it is important to remember that infection prevention and control practices in healthcare settings remain of paramount importance, as do the mitigations to prevent spread in our daily lives.  “The risk of transmission did not go down to zero after the healthcare worker was vaccinated.” Current UK government guidelines still require vaccinated people to follow the same rules as unvaccinated people when it comes to wearing a mask. Some of the vaccines do contain GMOs. For example, the AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a virus, which carries the genetic instructions for producing the coronavirus spike protein into human cells, without replicating itself and infecting the body.   Some vaccines use a virus as the active ingredient. As mentioned, for example, the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine uses a virus. Viruses need cells to replicate, so vaccine manufacturers use cells to manufacture enough of the virus for their vaccines. For example, the influenza vaccine is often made using chicken eggs. For the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, the virus is replicated using modified copies of cells taken from an aborted foetus in the 1970s. This cell line is called HEK-293 and we’ve written about it before.  The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a different virus grown in cells taken from an aborted foetus in 1985. So both vaccines are produced using copies of copies of these cells, rather than the original foetal cells themselves. And while the cells are used to grow the virus, they are filtered out of the vaccine, meaning neither vaccine “contain[s] aborted human...cells.” It’s unclear where the reference to monkey cells comes from, but it may be a misinterpretation of the fact that the virus used in the AstraZeneca vaccine is an altered version of a virus that typically infects chimpanzees. This doesn’t mean it comes from chimpanzees. There is no evidence that mRNA vaccines would impact fertility, but until more research is done to confirm they are safe for pregnant women, the NHS is currently recommending most pregnant women do not receive any Covid-19 vaccine. It says pregnant women with pre-existing conditions who might be at risk of developing severe complications should they contract the illness, and women who are at high risk of contracting the disease due to where they work, may still be able to get the vaccination. The reason why there has been concern is because the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bears a slight resemblance to proteins in the placenta. The theory being that if the vaccine leads to the body producing antibodies which attack the virus, those antibodies might also attack the placenta. But as we’ve said the resemblance is only slight and realistically the body is not likely to confuse the two.  If this was the case, then Covid-19 infection itself would also lead to fertility problems, and this had not been observed. We’ve written about this before.  As mentioned, many people may experience side effects with Covid-19 vaccines but these are overwhelmingly mild and pass within a few days.  Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. As we’ve said, these are then investigated to determine whether the vaccine was the cause or not. In the US there is a similar system for reporting suspected side effects called VAERS.  We’ve written more about claims linking vaccinations and specific side effects. No deaths have been directly attributed to Covid-19 vaccinations. As mentioned, in the UK, deaths and side effects can be reported to the Yellow Card scheme for investigation. As of 14 March, none of the deaths reported were found to be caused by vaccinations. By contrast, Covid-19 itself is estimated to kill around 0.5-1% of people who are infected in countries with similar age profiles and healthcare to the UK.  In the UK the vaccines have gone through all the normal safety checks and received temporary authorisation to be rolled out, but they have not been fully “licensed”. This means that vaccine manufacturers are free from some types of liability. However manufacturers aren’t fully protected. For example, the UK government says that manufacturers will still be liable if their vaccines do not meet safety standards or are “defective”. Some doctors and scientists are recommending people not to take Covid-19 vaccines.  Far more doctors, health professionals and public health bodies are recommending the vaccine and they have been

Covid vaccine ‘Q&A’: fact checked,,,,,,
38,,,,True,Abbas Panjwani,2021-03-25,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,Vaccine manufacturers are not liable for injuries or deaths caused by the vaccines.,2021-03-25,fullfact,,"A Covid-19 vaccine “Q&A” sheet has been circulating on social media. It presents a checklist of claims about the vaccine, alongside ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ answers. Some of the claims are inaccurate and suggest the mRNA vaccines may be dangerous. The Covid-19 vaccines have been tested to the same high standards as any vaccine would be. While side effects are common, these are overwhelmingly minor and pass within a few days.   While these are the first mRNA vaccines to be rolled out to the general public, the technology behind mRNA vaccines has been developed over a number of years.   In the UK, two of the three approved Covid-19 vaccines , the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine - use mRNA technology.  Both mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would. Many vaccines work by introducing a weakened or inactive virus or bacteria into the body which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies in response. These antibodies then protect the body if it comes into contact with the real thing. Covid-19 mRNA vaccines go one step back in the process. Once inside the body, the mRNA works to build the spike proteins on the surface of the Covid-19 virus. The body then responds by producing antibodies which attack those proteins.This means that if it is later infected, the body will be able to generate a faster and more effective immune response to the virus. This is untrue. The Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have all been tested on animals. The Associated Press reports this confusion may have arisen because Moderna and Pfizer were given permission to test their vaccines on human trial participants concurrently with animal tests. Ordinarily animal tests are done before human trials.  “Have they been subject to medium or long term safety testing on humans? No” This depends on how you define medium or long term. The vaccines have been trialled on humans since mid-2020, so we do have over six months of safety data for each vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna have said they will continue monitoring their trialists for safety. It’s unclear what’s meant by “reversible”.  All the vaccines are intended to protect people against Covid-19. It is unclear how long that protection will last, and so in that sense the effects of the vaccines may wear off over time. The vaccines can cause side effects but the vast majority of these, such as pain around the injection site, fatigue or nausea, are mild and pass within a few days.  The evidence suggesting vaccinations can cause more serious side effects resulting in permanent damage is far more limited. For example in the Pfizer trial, the proportion of people who experienced a serious “adverse event” after vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine was 0.6% and among the group of people who received the placebo it was 0.5%. Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. These reports are then investigated to determine whether there is any link to the vaccines. All the vaccines available significantly reduce the risk of developing Covid-19. Looking specifically at the mRNA vaccines, on clinical trials, participants who had received the Moderna vaccine were 94% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo, and none developed “severe Covid”. Recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 95% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo. In real-world data from Israel, recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 94% less likely to develop symptomatic Covid-19 and 92% less likely to contract “severe Covid”. Emerging evidence suggests the vaccines also stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19, as well as stopping those infections turning into symptomatic illnesses. For example, a recent Scottish study, which hasn’t been peer reviewed yet, found that the rate of infection among people who live with healthcare workers was at least 30% lower when the worker had been vaccinated.  Public Health Scotland (PHS) said: “Since household members of healthcare workers can also be infected via other people (not just via the healthcare worker they live with), this 30% relative risk reduction is an underestimate of the ‘true’ effect of vaccination on transmission.” But Dr Diane Stockton, PHS Lead for COVID-19 Vaccination Surveillance Programme, also said: ""Despite this good news, it is important to remember that infection prevention and control practices in healthcare settings remain of paramount importance, as do the mitigations to prevent spread in our daily lives.  “The risk of transmission did not go down to zero after the healthcare worker was vaccinated.” Current UK government guidelines still require vaccinated people to follow the same rules as unvaccinated people when it comes to wearing a mask. Some of the vaccines do contain GMOs. For example, the AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a virus, which carries the genetic instructions for producing the coronavirus spike protein into human cells, without replicating itself and infecting the body.   Some vaccines use a virus as the active ingredient. As mentioned, for example, the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine uses a virus. Viruses need cells to replicate, so vaccine manufacturers use cells to manufacture enough of the virus for their vaccines. For example, the influenza vaccine is often made using chicken eggs. For the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, the virus is replicated using modified copies of cells taken from an aborted foetus in the 1970s. This cell line is called HEK-293 and we’ve written about it before.  The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a different virus grown in cells taken from an aborted foetus in 1985. So both vaccines are produced using copies of copies of these cells, rather than the original foetal cells themselves. And while the cells are used to grow the virus, they are filtered out of the vaccine, meaning neither vaccine “contain[s] aborted human...cells.” It’s unclear where the reference to monkey cells comes from, but it may be a misinterpretation of the fact that the virus used in the AstraZeneca vaccine is an altered version of a virus that typically infects chimpanzees. This doesn’t mean it comes from chimpanzees. There is no evidence that mRNA vaccines would impact fertility, but until more research is done to confirm they are safe for pregnant women, the NHS is currently recommending most pregnant women do not receive any Covid-19 vaccine. It says pregnant women with pre-existing conditions who might be at risk of developing severe complications should they contract the illness, and women who are at high risk of contracting the disease due to where they work, may still be able to get the vaccination. The reason why there has been concern is because the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bears a slight resemblance to proteins in the placenta. The theory being that if the vaccine leads to the body producing antibodies which attack the virus, those antibodies might also attack the placenta. But as we’ve said the resemblance is only slight and realistically the body is not likely to confuse the two.  If this was the case, then Covid-19 infection itself would also lead to fertility problems, and this had not been observed. We’ve written about this before.  As mentioned, many people may experience side effects with Covid-19 vaccines but these are overwhelmingly mild and pass within a few days.  Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. As we’ve said, these are then investigated to determine whether the vaccine was the cause or not. In the US there is a similar system for reporting suspected side effects called VAERS.  We’ve written more about claims linking vaccinations and specific side effects. No deaths have been directly attributed to Covid-19 vaccinations. As mentioned, in the UK, deaths and side effects can be reported to the Yellow Card scheme for investigation. As of 14 March, none of the deaths reported were found to be caused by vaccinations. By contrast, Covid-19 itself is estimated to kill around 0.5-1% of people who are infected in countries with similar age profiles and healthcare to the UK.  In the UK the vaccines have gone through all the normal safety checks and received temporary authorisation to be rolled out, but they have not been fully “licensed”. This means that vaccine manufacturers are free from some types of liability. However manufacturers aren’t fully protected. For example, the UK government says that manufacturers will still be liable if their vaccines do not meet safety standards or are “defective”. Some doctors and scientists are recommending people not to take Covid-19 vaccines.  Far more doctors, health professionals and public health bodies are recommending the vaccine and they have been

Covid vaccine ‘Q&A’: fact checked,,,,,,
39,,,,True,Abbas Panjwani,2021-03-25,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,Vaccine manufacturers are not liable for injuries or deaths caused by the vaccines.,2021-03-25,fullfact,,"A Covid-19 vaccine “Q&A” sheet has been circulating on social media. It presents a checklist of claims about the vaccine, alongside ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ answers. Some of the claims are inaccurate and suggest the mRNA vaccines may be dangerous. The Covid-19 vaccines have been tested to the same high standards as any vaccine would be. While side effects are common, these are overwhelmingly minor and pass within a few days.   While these are the first mRNA vaccines to be rolled out to the general public, the technology behind mRNA vaccines has been developed over a number of years.   In the UK, two of the three approved Covid-19 vaccines , the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine - use mRNA technology.  Both mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would. Many vaccines work by introducing a weakened or inactive virus or bacteria into the body which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies in response. These antibodies then protect the body if it comes into contact with the real thing. Covid-19 mRNA vaccines go one step back in the process. Once inside the body, the mRNA works to build the spike proteins on the surface of the Covid-19 virus. The body then responds by producing antibodies which attack those proteins.This means that if it is later infected, the body will be able to generate a faster and more effective immune response to the virus. This is untrue. The Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have all been tested on animals. The Associated Press reports this confusion may have arisen because Moderna and Pfizer were given permission to test their vaccines on human trial participants concurrently with animal tests. Ordinarily animal tests are done before human trials.  “Have they been subject to medium or long term safety testing on humans? No” This depends on how you define medium or long term. The vaccines have been trialled on humans since mid-2020, so we do have over six months of safety data for each vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna have said they will continue monitoring their trialists for safety. It’s unclear what’s meant by “reversible”.  All the vaccines are intended to protect people against Covid-19. It is unclear how long that protection will last, and so in that sense the effects of the vaccines may wear off over time. The vaccines can cause side effects but the vast majority of these, such as pain around the injection site, fatigue or nausea, are mild and pass within a few days.  The evidence suggesting vaccinations can cause more serious side effects resulting in permanent damage is far more limited. For example in the Pfizer trial, the proportion of people who experienced a serious “adverse event” after vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine was 0.6% and among the group of people who received the placebo it was 0.5%. Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. These reports are then investigated to determine whether there is any link to the vaccines. All the vaccines available significantly reduce the risk of developing Covid-19. Looking specifically at the mRNA vaccines, on clinical trials, participants who had received the Moderna vaccine were 94% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo, and none developed “severe Covid”. Recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 95% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo. In real-world data from Israel, recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 94% less likely to develop symptomatic Covid-19 and 92% less likely to contract “severe Covid”. Emerging evidence suggests the vaccines also stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19, as well as stopping those infections turning into symptomatic illnesses. For example, a recent Scottish study, which hasn’t been peer reviewed yet, found that the rate of infection among people who live with healthcare workers was at least 30% lower when the worker had been vaccinated.  Public Health Scotland (PHS) said: “Since household members of healthcare workers can also be infected via other people (not just via the healthcare worker they live with), this 30% relative risk reduction is an underestimate of the ‘true’ effect of vaccination on transmission.” But Dr Diane Stockton, PHS Lead for COVID-19 Vaccination Surveillance Programme, also said: ""Despite this good news, it is important to remember that infection prevention and control practices in healthcare settings remain of paramount importance, as do the mitigations to prevent spread in our daily lives.  “The risk of transmission did not go down to zero after the healthcare worker was vaccinated.” Current UK government guidelines still require vaccinated people to follow the same rules as unvaccinated people when it comes to wearing a mask. Some of the vaccines do contain GMOs. For example, the AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a virus, which carries the genetic instructions for producing the coronavirus spike protein into human cells, without replicating itself and infecting the body.   Some vaccines use a virus as the active ingredient. As mentioned, for example, the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine uses a virus. Viruses need cells to replicate, so vaccine manufacturers use cells to manufacture enough of the virus for their vaccines. For example, the influenza vaccine is often made using chicken eggs. For the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, the virus is replicated using modified copies of cells taken from an aborted foetus in the 1970s. This cell line is called HEK-293 and we’ve written about it before.  The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a different virus grown in cells taken from an aborted foetus in 1985. So both vaccines are produced using copies of copies of these cells, rather than the original foetal cells themselves. And while the cells are used to grow the virus, they are filtered out of the vaccine, meaning neither vaccine “contain[s] aborted human...cells.” It’s unclear where the reference to monkey cells comes from, but it may be a misinterpretation of the fact that the virus used in the AstraZeneca vaccine is an altered version of a virus that typically infects chimpanzees. This doesn’t mean it comes from chimpanzees. There is no evidence that mRNA vaccines would impact fertility, but until more research is done to confirm they are safe for pregnant women, the NHS is currently recommending most pregnant women do not receive any Covid-19 vaccine. It says pregnant women with pre-existing conditions who might be at risk of developing severe complications should they contract the illness, and women who are at high risk of contracting the disease due to where they work, may still be able to get the vaccination. The reason why there has been concern is because the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bears a slight resemblance to proteins in the placenta. The theory being that if the vaccine leads to the body producing antibodies which attack the virus, those antibodies might also attack the placenta. But as we’ve said the resemblance is only slight and realistically the body is not likely to confuse the two.  If this was the case, then Covid-19 infection itself would also lead to fertility problems, and this had not been observed. We’ve written about this before.  As mentioned, many people may experience side effects with Covid-19 vaccines but these are overwhelmingly mild and pass within a few days.  Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. As we’ve said, these are then investigated to determine whether the vaccine was the cause or not. In the US there is a similar system for reporting suspected side effects called VAERS.  We’ve written more about claims linking vaccinations and specific side effects. No deaths have been directly attributed to Covid-19 vaccinations. As mentioned, in the UK, deaths and side effects can be reported to the Yellow Card scheme for investigation. As of 14 March, none of the deaths reported were found to be caused by vaccinations. By contrast, Covid-19 itself is estimated to kill around 0.5-1% of people who are infected in countries with similar age profiles and healthcare to the UK.  In the UK the vaccines have gone through all the normal safety checks and received temporary authorisation to be rolled out, but they have not been fully “licensed”. This means that vaccine manufacturers are free from some types of liability. However manufacturers aren’t fully protected. For example, the UK government says that manufacturers will still be liable if their vaccines do not meet safety standards or are “defective”. Some doctors and scientists are recommending people not to take Covid-19 vaccines.  Far more doctors, health professionals and public health bodies are recommending the vaccine and they have been

Covid vaccine ‘Q&A’: fact checked,,,,,,
40,,,,True,Abbas Panjwani,2021-03-25,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,Vaccine manufacturers are not liable for injuries or deaths caused by the vaccines.,2021-03-25,fullfact,,"A Covid-19 vaccine “Q&A” sheet has been circulating on social media. It presents a checklist of claims about the vaccine, alongside ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ answers. Some of the claims are inaccurate and suggest the mRNA vaccines may be dangerous. The Covid-19 vaccines have been tested to the same high standards as any vaccine would be. While side effects are common, these are overwhelmingly minor and pass within a few days.   While these are the first mRNA vaccines to be rolled out to the general public, the technology behind mRNA vaccines has been developed over a number of years.   In the UK, two of the three approved Covid-19 vaccines , the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine - use mRNA technology.  Both mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would. Many vaccines work by introducing a weakened or inactive virus or bacteria into the body which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies in response. These antibodies then protect the body if it comes into contact with the real thing. Covid-19 mRNA vaccines go one step back in the process. Once inside the body, the mRNA works to build the spike proteins on the surface of the Covid-19 virus. The body then responds by producing antibodies which attack those proteins.This means that if it is later infected, the body will be able to generate a faster and more effective immune response to the virus. This is untrue. The Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have all been tested on animals. The Associated Press reports this confusion may have arisen because Moderna and Pfizer were given permission to test their vaccines on human trial participants concurrently with animal tests. Ordinarily animal tests are done before human trials.  “Have they been subject to medium or long term safety testing on humans? No” This depends on how you define medium or long term. The vaccines have been trialled on humans since mid-2020, so we do have over six months of safety data for each vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna have said they will continue monitoring their trialists for safety. It’s unclear what’s meant by “reversible”.  All the vaccines are intended to protect people against Covid-19. It is unclear how long that protection will last, and so in that sense the effects of the vaccines may wear off over time. The vaccines can cause side effects but the vast majority of these, such as pain around the injection site, fatigue or nausea, are mild and pass within a few days.  The evidence suggesting vaccinations can cause more serious side effects resulting in permanent damage is far more limited. For example in the Pfizer trial, the proportion of people who experienced a serious “adverse event” after vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine was 0.6% and among the group of people who received the placebo it was 0.5%. Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. These reports are then investigated to determine whether there is any link to the vaccines. All the vaccines available significantly reduce the risk of developing Covid-19. Looking specifically at the mRNA vaccines, on clinical trials, participants who had received the Moderna vaccine were 94% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo, and none developed “severe Covid”. Recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 95% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo. In real-world data from Israel, recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 94% less likely to develop symptomatic Covid-19 and 92% less likely to contract “severe Covid”. Emerging evidence suggests the vaccines also stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19, as well as stopping those infections turning into symptomatic illnesses. For example, a recent Scottish study, which hasn’t been peer reviewed yet, found that the rate of infection among people who live with healthcare workers was at least 30% lower when the worker had been vaccinated.  Public Health Scotland (PHS) said: “Since household members of healthcare workers can also be infected via other people (not just via the healthcare worker they live with), this 30% relative risk reduction is an underestimate of the ‘true’ effect of vaccination on transmission.” But Dr Diane Stockton, PHS Lead for COVID-19 Vaccination Surveillance Programme, also said: ""Despite this good news, it is important to remember that infection prevention and control practices in healthcare settings remain of paramount importance, as do the mitigations to prevent spread in our daily lives.  “The risk of transmission did not go down to zero after the healthcare worker was vaccinated.” Current UK government guidelines still require vaccinated people to follow the same rules as unvaccinated people when it comes to wearing a mask. Some of the vaccines do contain GMOs. For example, the AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a virus, which carries the genetic instructions for producing the coronavirus spike protein into human cells, without replicating itself and infecting the body.   Some vaccines use a virus as the active ingredient. As mentioned, for example, the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine uses a virus. Viruses need cells to replicate, so vaccine manufacturers use cells to manufacture enough of the virus for their vaccines. For example, the influenza vaccine is often made using chicken eggs. For the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, the virus is replicated using modified copies of cells taken from an aborted foetus in the 1970s. This cell line is called HEK-293 and we’ve written about it before.  The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a different virus grown in cells taken from an aborted foetus in 1985. So both vaccines are produced using copies of copies of these cells, rather than the original foetal cells themselves. And while the cells are used to grow the virus, they are filtered out of the vaccine, meaning neither vaccine “contain[s] aborted human...cells.” It’s unclear where the reference to monkey cells comes from, but it may be a misinterpretation of the fact that the virus used in the AstraZeneca vaccine is an altered version of a virus that typically infects chimpanzees. This doesn’t mean it comes from chimpanzees. There is no evidence that mRNA vaccines would impact fertility, but until more research is done to confirm they are safe for pregnant women, the NHS is currently recommending most pregnant women do not receive any Covid-19 vaccine. It says pregnant women with pre-existing conditions who might be at risk of developing severe complications should they contract the illness, and women who are at high risk of contracting the disease due to where they work, may still be able to get the vaccination. The reason why there has been concern is because the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bears a slight resemblance to proteins in the placenta. The theory being that if the vaccine leads to the body producing antibodies which attack the virus, those antibodies might also attack the placenta. But as we’ve said the resemblance is only slight and realistically the body is not likely to confuse the two.  If this was the case, then Covid-19 infection itself would also lead to fertility problems, and this had not been observed. We’ve written about this before.  As mentioned, many people may experience side effects with Covid-19 vaccines but these are overwhelmingly mild and pass within a few days.  Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. As we’ve said, these are then investigated to determine whether the vaccine was the cause or not. In the US there is a similar system for reporting suspected side effects called VAERS.  We’ve written more about claims linking vaccinations and specific side effects. No deaths have been directly attributed to Covid-19 vaccinations. As mentioned, in the UK, deaths and side effects can be reported to the Yellow Card scheme for investigation. As of 14 March, none of the deaths reported were found to be caused by vaccinations. By contrast, Covid-19 itself is estimated to kill around 0.5-1% of people who are infected in countries with similar age profiles and healthcare to the UK.  In the UK the vaccines have gone through all the normal safety checks and received temporary authorisation to be rolled out, but they have not been fully “licensed”. This means that vaccine manufacturers are free from some types of liability. However manufacturers aren’t fully protected. For example, the UK government says that manufacturers will still be liable if their vaccines do not meet safety standards or are “defective”. Some doctors and scientists are recommending people not to take Covid-19 vaccines.  Far more doctors, health professionals and public health bodies are recommending the vaccine and they have been

Covid vaccine ‘Q&A’: fact checked,,,,,,
41,,,,True,Abbas Panjwani,2021-03-25,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,Vaccine manufacturers are not liable for injuries or deaths caused by the vaccines.,2021-03-25,fullfact,,"A Covid-19 vaccine “Q&A” sheet has been circulating on social media. It presents a checklist of claims about the vaccine, alongside ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ answers. Some of the claims are inaccurate and suggest the mRNA vaccines may be dangerous. The Covid-19 vaccines have been tested to the same high standards as any vaccine would be. While side effects are common, these are overwhelmingly minor and pass within a few days.   While these are the first mRNA vaccines to be rolled out to the general public, the technology behind mRNA vaccines has been developed over a number of years.   In the UK, two of the three approved Covid-19 vaccines , the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine - use mRNA technology.  Both mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would. Many vaccines work by introducing a weakened or inactive virus or bacteria into the body which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies in response. These antibodies then protect the body if it comes into contact with the real thing. Covid-19 mRNA vaccines go one step back in the process. Once inside the body, the mRNA works to build the spike proteins on the surface of the Covid-19 virus. The body then responds by producing antibodies which attack those proteins.This means that if it is later infected, the body will be able to generate a faster and more effective immune response to the virus. This is untrue. The Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have all been tested on animals. The Associated Press reports this confusion may have arisen because Moderna and Pfizer were given permission to test their vaccines on human trial participants concurrently with animal tests. Ordinarily animal tests are done before human trials.  “Have they been subject to medium or long term safety testing on humans? No” This depends on how you define medium or long term. The vaccines have been trialled on humans since mid-2020, so we do have over six months of safety data for each vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna have said they will continue monitoring their trialists for safety. It’s unclear what’s meant by “reversible”.  All the vaccines are intended to protect people against Covid-19. It is unclear how long that protection will last, and so in that sense the effects of the vaccines may wear off over time. The vaccines can cause side effects but the vast majority of these, such as pain around the injection site, fatigue or nausea, are mild and pass within a few days.  The evidence suggesting vaccinations can cause more serious side effects resulting in permanent damage is far more limited. For example in the Pfizer trial, the proportion of people who experienced a serious “adverse event” after vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine was 0.6% and among the group of people who received the placebo it was 0.5%. Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. These reports are then investigated to determine whether there is any link to the vaccines. All the vaccines available significantly reduce the risk of developing Covid-19. Looking specifically at the mRNA vaccines, on clinical trials, participants who had received the Moderna vaccine were 94% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo, and none developed “severe Covid”. Recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 95% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo. In real-world data from Israel, recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 94% less likely to develop symptomatic Covid-19 and 92% less likely to contract “severe Covid”. Emerging evidence suggests the vaccines also stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19, as well as stopping those infections turning into symptomatic illnesses. For example, a recent Scottish study, which hasn’t been peer reviewed yet, found that the rate of infection among people who live with healthcare workers was at least 30% lower when the worker had been vaccinated.  Public Health Scotland (PHS) said: “Since household members of healthcare workers can also be infected via other people (not just via the healthcare worker they live with), this 30% relative risk reduction is an underestimate of the ‘true’ effect of vaccination on transmission.” But Dr Diane Stockton, PHS Lead for COVID-19 Vaccination Surveillance Programme, also said: ""Despite this good news, it is important to remember that infection prevention and control practices in healthcare settings remain of paramount importance, as do the mitigations to prevent spread in our daily lives.  “The risk of transmission did not go down to zero after the healthcare worker was vaccinated.” Current UK government guidelines still require vaccinated people to follow the same rules as unvaccinated people when it comes to wearing a mask. Some of the vaccines do contain GMOs. For example, the AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a virus, which carries the genetic instructions for producing the coronavirus spike protein into human cells, without replicating itself and infecting the body.   Some vaccines use a virus as the active ingredient. As mentioned, for example, the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine uses a virus. Viruses need cells to replicate, so vaccine manufacturers use cells to manufacture enough of the virus for their vaccines. For example, the influenza vaccine is often made using chicken eggs. For the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, the virus is replicated using modified copies of cells taken from an aborted foetus in the 1970s. This cell line is called HEK-293 and we’ve written about it before.  The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a different virus grown in cells taken from an aborted foetus in 1985. So both vaccines are produced using copies of copies of these cells, rather than the original foetal cells themselves. And while the cells are used to grow the virus, they are filtered out of the vaccine, meaning neither vaccine “contain[s] aborted human...cells.” It’s unclear where the reference to monkey cells comes from, but it may be a misinterpretation of the fact that the virus used in the AstraZeneca vaccine is an altered version of a virus that typically infects chimpanzees. This doesn’t mean it comes from chimpanzees. There is no evidence that mRNA vaccines would impact fertility, but until more research is done to confirm they are safe for pregnant women, the NHS is currently recommending most pregnant women do not receive any Covid-19 vaccine. It says pregnant women with pre-existing conditions who might be at risk of developing severe complications should they contract the illness, and women who are at high risk of contracting the disease due to where they work, may still be able to get the vaccination. The reason why there has been concern is because the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bears a slight resemblance to proteins in the placenta. The theory being that if the vaccine leads to the body producing antibodies which attack the virus, those antibodies might also attack the placenta. But as we’ve said the resemblance is only slight and realistically the body is not likely to confuse the two.  If this was the case, then Covid-19 infection itself would also lead to fertility problems, and this had not been observed. We’ve written about this before.  As mentioned, many people may experience side effects with Covid-19 vaccines but these are overwhelmingly mild and pass within a few days.  Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. As we’ve said, these are then investigated to determine whether the vaccine was the cause or not. In the US there is a similar system for reporting suspected side effects called VAERS.  We’ve written more about claims linking vaccinations and specific side effects. No deaths have been directly attributed to Covid-19 vaccinations. As mentioned, in the UK, deaths and side effects can be reported to the Yellow Card scheme for investigation. As of 14 March, none of the deaths reported were found to be caused by vaccinations. By contrast, Covid-19 itself is estimated to kill around 0.5-1% of people who are infected in countries with similar age profiles and healthcare to the UK.  In the UK the vaccines have gone through all the normal safety checks and received temporary authorisation to be rolled out, but they have not been fully “licensed”. This means that vaccine manufacturers are free from some types of liability. However manufacturers aren’t fully protected. For example, the UK government says that manufacturers will still be liable if their vaccines do not meet safety standards or are “defective”. Some doctors and scientists are recommending people not to take Covid-19 vaccines.  Far more doctors, health professionals and public health bodies are recommending the vaccine and they have been

Covid vaccine ‘Q&A’: fact checked,,,,,,
42,,,,True,Abbas Panjwani,2021-03-25,,fullfact,,https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-QA-graphic/,Vaccine manufacturers are not liable for injuries or deaths caused by the vaccines.,2021-03-25,fullfact,,"A Covid-19 vaccine “Q&A” sheet has been circulating on social media. It presents a checklist of claims about the vaccine, alongside ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ answers. Some of the claims are inaccurate and suggest the mRNA vaccines may be dangerous. The Covid-19 vaccines have been tested to the same high standards as any vaccine would be. While side effects are common, these are overwhelmingly minor and pass within a few days.   While these are the first mRNA vaccines to be rolled out to the general public, the technology behind mRNA vaccines has been developed over a number of years.   In the UK, two of the three approved Covid-19 vaccines , the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine - use mRNA technology.  Both mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would. Many vaccines work by introducing a weakened or inactive virus or bacteria into the body which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies in response. These antibodies then protect the body if it comes into contact with the real thing. Covid-19 mRNA vaccines go one step back in the process. Once inside the body, the mRNA works to build the spike proteins on the surface of the Covid-19 virus. The body then responds by producing antibodies which attack those proteins.This means that if it is later infected, the body will be able to generate a faster and more effective immune response to the virus. This is untrue. The Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have all been tested on animals. The Associated Press reports this confusion may have arisen because Moderna and Pfizer were given permission to test their vaccines on human trial participants concurrently with animal tests. Ordinarily animal tests are done before human trials.  “Have they been subject to medium or long term safety testing on humans? No” This depends on how you define medium or long term. The vaccines have been trialled on humans since mid-2020, so we do have over six months of safety data for each vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna have said they will continue monitoring their trialists for safety. It’s unclear what’s meant by “reversible”.  All the vaccines are intended to protect people against Covid-19. It is unclear how long that protection will last, and so in that sense the effects of the vaccines may wear off over time. The vaccines can cause side effects but the vast majority of these, such as pain around the injection site, fatigue or nausea, are mild and pass within a few days.  The evidence suggesting vaccinations can cause more serious side effects resulting in permanent damage is far more limited. For example in the Pfizer trial, the proportion of people who experienced a serious “adverse event” after vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine was 0.6% and among the group of people who received the placebo it was 0.5%. Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. These reports are then investigated to determine whether there is any link to the vaccines. All the vaccines available significantly reduce the risk of developing Covid-19. Looking specifically at the mRNA vaccines, on clinical trials, participants who had received the Moderna vaccine were 94% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo, and none developed “severe Covid”. Recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 95% less likely to contract Covid-19 than participants who received the placebo. In real-world data from Israel, recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 94% less likely to develop symptomatic Covid-19 and 92% less likely to contract “severe Covid”. Emerging evidence suggests the vaccines also stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19, as well as stopping those infections turning into symptomatic illnesses. For example, a recent Scottish study, which hasn’t been peer reviewed yet, found that the rate of infection among people who live with healthcare workers was at least 30% lower when the worker had been vaccinated.  Public Health Scotland (PHS) said: “Since household members of healthcare workers can also be infected via other people (not just via the healthcare worker they live with), this 30% relative risk reduction is an underestimate of the ‘true’ effect of vaccination on transmission.” But Dr Diane Stockton, PHS Lead for COVID-19 Vaccination Surveillance Programme, also said: ""Despite this good news, it is important to remember that infection prevention and control practices in healthcare settings remain of paramount importance, as do the mitigations to prevent spread in our daily lives.  “The risk of transmission did not go down to zero after the healthcare worker was vaccinated.” Current UK government guidelines still require vaccinated people to follow the same rules as unvaccinated people when it comes to wearing a mask. Some of the vaccines do contain GMOs. For example, the AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a virus, which carries the genetic instructions for producing the coronavirus spike protein into human cells, without replicating itself and infecting the body.   Some vaccines use a virus as the active ingredient. As mentioned, for example, the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine uses a virus. Viruses need cells to replicate, so vaccine manufacturers use cells to manufacture enough of the virus for their vaccines. For example, the influenza vaccine is often made using chicken eggs. For the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, the virus is replicated using modified copies of cells taken from an aborted foetus in the 1970s. This cell line is called HEK-293 and we’ve written about it before.  The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a different virus grown in cells taken from an aborted foetus in 1985. So both vaccines are produced using copies of copies of these cells, rather than the original foetal cells themselves. And while the cells are used to grow the virus, they are filtered out of the vaccine, meaning neither vaccine “contain[s] aborted human...cells.” It’s unclear where the reference to monkey cells comes from, but it may be a misinterpretation of the fact that the virus used in the AstraZeneca vaccine is an altered version of a virus that typically infects chimpanzees. This doesn’t mean it comes from chimpanzees. There is no evidence that mRNA vaccines would impact fertility, but until more research is done to confirm they are safe for pregnant women, the NHS is currently recommending most pregnant women do not receive any Covid-19 vaccine. It says pregnant women with pre-existing conditions who might be at risk of developing severe complications should they contract the illness, and women who are at high risk of contracting the disease due to where they work, may still be able to get the vaccination. The reason why there has been concern is because the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bears a slight resemblance to proteins in the placenta. The theory being that if the vaccine leads to the body producing antibodies which attack the virus, those antibodies might also attack the placenta. But as we’ve said the resemblance is only slight and realistically the body is not likely to confuse the two.  If this was the case, then Covid-19 infection itself would also lead to fertility problems, and this had not been observed. We’ve written about this before.  As mentioned, many people may experience side effects with Covid-19 vaccines but these are overwhelmingly mild and pass within a few days.  Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. As we’ve said, these are then investigated to determine whether the vaccine was the cause or not. In the US there is a similar system for reporting suspected side effects called VAERS.  We’ve written more about claims linking vaccinations and specific side effects. No deaths have been directly attributed to Covid-19 vaccinations. As mentioned, in the UK, deaths and side effects can be reported to the Yellow Card scheme for investigation. As of 14 March, none of the deaths reported were found to be caused by vaccinations. By contrast, Covid-19 itself is estimated to kill around 0.5-1% of people who are infected in countries with similar age profiles and healthcare to the UK.  In the UK the vaccines have gone through all the normal safety checks and received temporary authorisation to be rolled out, but they have not been fully “licensed”. This means that vaccine manufacturers are free from some types of liability. However manufacturers aren’t fully protected. For example, the UK government says that manufacturers will still be liable if their vaccines do not meet safety standards or are “defective”. Some doctors and scientists are recommending people not to take Covid-19 vaccines.  Far more doctors, health professionals and public health bodies are recommending the vaccine and they have been
